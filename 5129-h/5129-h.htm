    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE BOY AT THE BARONY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Quintards had not prospered on the barren lands of the pine woods
      whither they had emigrated to escape the malaria of the low coast, but
      this no longer mattered, for the last of his name and race, old General
      Quintard, was dead in the great house his father had built almost a
      century before and the thin acres of the Barony, where he had made his
      last stand against age and poverty, were to claim him, now that he had
      given up the struggle in their midst. The two or three old slaves about
      the place, stricken with a sense of the futility of the fight their master
      had made, mourned for him and for themselves, but of his own blood and
      class none was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shy dwellers from the pine woods, lanky jeans-clad men and sunbonneted
      women, who were gathering for the burial of the famous man of their
      neighborhood, grouped themselves about the lawn which had long since sunk
      to the uses of a pasture lot. Singly or by twos and threes they stole up
      the steps and across the wide porch to the open door. On the right of the
      long hall another door stood open, and who wished could enter the
      drawing-room, with its splendid green and gold paper, and the wonderful
      fireplace with the Dutch tiles that graphically depicted the story of
      Jonah and the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the general lay in state. The slaves had dressed their old master in
      the uniform he had worn as a colonel of the continental line, but the thin
      shoulders of the wasted figure no longer filled the buff and blue coat.
      The high-bred face, once proud and masterful no doubt, as became the face
      of a Quintard, spoke of more than age and poverty&mdash;it was infinitely
      sorrowful. Yet there was something harsh and unforgiving in the lines
      death had fixed there, which might have been taken as the visible impress
      of that mystery, the bitterness of which had misshaped the dead man's
      nature; but the resolute lips had closed for ever on their secret, and the
      broken spirit had gone perhaps to learn how poor a thing its pride had
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he had lived continuously at the Barony for almost a quarter of a
      century, there was none among his neighbors who could say he had looked on
      that thin, aquiline face in all that time. Yet they had known much of him,
      for the gossip of the slaves, who had been his only friends in those years
      he had chosen to deny himself to other friends, had gone far and wide over
      the county.
    </p>
    <p>
      That notable man of business, Jonathan Crenshaw&mdash;and this superiority
      was especially evident when the business chanced to be his own&mdash;was
      closeted in the library with a stranger to whom rumor fixed the name of
      Bladen, supposing him to be the legal representative of certain remote
      connections of the old general's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crenshaw sat before the flat-topped mahogany desk in the center of the
      room with several well-thumbed account-books open before him. Bladen, in
      riding dress, stood by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you will buy in the property when it comes up for sale?&rdquo; the
      latter was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crenshaw had already made it plain that General Quintard's creditors
      would have lean pickings at the Barony, intimating that he himself was the
      chiefest of these and the one to suffer most grievously in pocket. Further
      than this, Mr. Bladen saw that the old house was a ruin, scarcely
      habitable, and that the thin acres, though they were many and a royal
      grant, were of the slightest value. Crenshaw nodded his acquiescence to
      the lawyer's conjecture touching the ultimate fate of the Barony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon, sir, I'll want to protect myself, but if there are any of his
      own kin who have a fancy to the place I'll put no obstacle in their way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the other creditors?&rdquo; asked Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There ain't none, sir; they just got tired waiting on him, and when they
      began to sue and get judgment the old general would send me word to settle
      with them, and their claims passed into my hands. I was in too deep to
      draw out. But for the last ten years his dealings were all with me; I
      furnished the supplies for the place here. It didn't amount to much, as
      there was only him and the darkies, and the account ran on from year to
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lived entirely alone, saw no one, I understand,&rdquo; said Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone with his two or three old slaves&mdash;yes, sir. He wouldn't even
      see me; Joe, his old nigger, would fetch orders for this or that. Once or
      twice I rode out to see him, but I wa'n't even allowed inside that door;
      the message I got was that he couldn't be disturbed, and the last time I
      come he sent me word that if I annoyed him again he would be forced to
      terminate our business relations. That was pretty strong talk, wa'n't it,
      when you consider that I could have sold the roof from over his head and
      the land from under his feet? Oh, well, I just put it down to
      childishness.&rdquo; There was a brief pause, then Crenshaw spoke again. &ldquo;I
      reckon, sir, if you know anything about the old general's private affairs
      you don't feel no call to speak on that point?&rdquo; he observed, and with
      evident regret. He had hoped that Bladen would clear up the mystery, for
      certainly it must have been some sinister tragedy that had cost the
      general his grip on life and for twenty years and more had made of him a
      recluse, so that the faces of his friends had become as the faces of
      strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, I know nothing of General Quintard's private, history. I am
      even unacquainted with my clients, who are distant cousins, but his
      nearest kin&mdash;they live in South Carolina. I was merely instructed to
      represent them in the event of his death and to look after their
      interests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's business,&rdquo; said Crenshaw, nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know is this: General Quintard was a conspicuous man in these parts
      fifty years ago; that was before my time, Mr. Crenshaw, and I take it,
      too, it was before yours; he married a Beaufort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he did,&rdquo; said Crenshaw, &ldquo;and there was one child, a daughter; she
      married a South Carolinian by the name of Turberville. I remember that,
      fo' they were married under the gallery in the hall. Great folks, those
      Turbervilles, rolling rich. My father was manager then fo' the general&mdash;that
      was nearly forty years ago. There was life here then, sir; the place was
      alive with niggers and the house full of guests from one month's end to
      another.&rdquo; He drummed on the desktop. &ldquo;Who'd a thought it wa'n't to last
      for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what became of the daughter who married Turberville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Died years ago,&rdquo; said Crenshaw. &ldquo;She was here the last time about thirty
      years back. It wa'n't so easy to get about in those days, no roads to
      speak of and no stages, and besides, the old general wa'n't much here
      nohow; her going away had sort of broken up his home, I reckon. Then the
      place stood empty fo' a few years, most of the slaves were sold off, and
      the fields began to grow up. No one rightly knew, but the general was
      supposed to be traveling up yonder in the No'th, sir. As I say, things ran
      along this way quite a while, and then one morning when I went to my store
      my clerk says, 'There's an old white-headed nigger been waiting round here
      fo' a word with you, Mr. Crenshaw.' It was Joe, the general's body
      servant, and when I'd shook hands with him I said, 'When's the master
      expected back?' You see, I thought Joe had been sent on ahead to open the
      house, but he says, 'General Quintard's at the Barony now,' and then he
      says, 'The general's compliments, sir, and will you see that this order is
      filled?' Well, Mr. Bladen, I and my father had factored the Barony fo'
      fifteen years and upward, but that was the first time the supplies fo' the
      general's table had ever been toted here in a meal sack!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rode out that very afternoon, but Joe, who was one of your mannerly
      niggers, met me at the door and says, 'Mr. Crenshaw, the general
      appreciates this courtesy, but regrets that he is unable to see you, sir.'
      After that it wa'n't long in getting about that the general was a changed
      man. Other folks came here to welcome him back and he refused to see them,
      but the reason of it we never learned. Joe, who probably knew, was one of
      your close niggers; there was, no getting anything out of him; you could
      talk with that darky by the hour, sir, and he left you feeling emptier
      than if he'd kept his mouth shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted by a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Crenshaw, a trifle impatiently, and in response to his
      bidding the door opened and a small boy entered the room dragging after
      him a long rifle. Suddenly overcome by a speechless shyness, he paused on
      the threshold to stare with round, wondering eyes at the two men. &ldquo;Well,
      sonny, what do you want?&rdquo; asked Mr. Crenshaw indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy opened his mouth, but his courage failed him, and with his courage
      went the words he would have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; asked Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell, you presently,&rdquo; said Crenshaw. &ldquo;Come, speak up, sonny, what do
      you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, I want this here old spo'tin' rifle,&rdquo; said: the child.
      &ldquo;Please, sir, I want to keep it,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you run along on out of here with your old spo'tin' rifle!&rdquo; said
      Crenshaw good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, am I to keep it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I reckon you may keep it&mdash;least I've no objection.&rdquo; Crenshaw
      glanced at Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by all means,&rdquo; said the latter. Spasms of delight shook the small
      figure, and with a murmur that was meant for thanks he backed from the
      room, closing the door. Bladen glanced inquiringly at Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to know about him, sir? Well, that's Hannibal Wayne Hazard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannibal Wayne Hazard?&rdquo; repeated Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; the general was the authority on that point, but who Hannibal
      Wayne Hazard is and how he happens to be at the Barony is another mystery&mdash;just
      wait a minute, sir&mdash;&rdquo; and quitting his chair Mr. Crenshaw hurried
      from the room to return almost immediately with a tall countryman. &ldquo;Mr.
      Bladen, this is Bob Yancy. Bob, the gentleman, wants to hear about the
      woman and the child; that's your story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Yancy. He appeared to meditate on the mental effort
      that was required of him, then he took a long breath. &ldquo;It was this a-ways&mdash;&rdquo;
       he began with a soft drawl, and then paused. &ldquo;You give me the dates, Mr.
      John, fo' I disremember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was four year ago come next Christmas,&rdquo; said Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Christmas,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Yancy. &ldquo;Our folks always kept the old
      Christmas like it was befo' they done mussed up the calendar. I'm agin all
      changes,&rdquo; added Mr. Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means the fo'teenth of December,&rdquo; explained Mr. Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not wishin' to dispute your word, Mr. John, I mean Christmas,&rdquo; objected
      Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well, he means Christmas then!&rdquo; said Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The evening befo', it was, and I'd gone to Fayetteville to get my
      Christmas fixin's; there was right much rain and some snow falling.&rdquo; Mr.
      Yancy's guiding light was clearly accuracy. &ldquo;Just at sundown I hooked up
      that blind mule of mine to the cart and started fo' home. As I got shut of
      the town the stage come in and I seen one passenger, a woman. Now that
      mule is slow, Mr. John; I'm free to say there are faster mules, but a set
      of harness never went acrost the back of a slower critter than that one of
      mine.&rdquo; Yancy, who thus far had addressed himself to Mr. Crenshaw, now
      turned to Bladen. &ldquo;That mule, sir, sees good with his right eye, but it's
      got a gait like it was looking fo' the left-hand side of the road and
      wondering what in thunderation had got into it that it was acrost the way;
      mules are gifted with some sense, but mighty little judgment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the mule, Bob,&rdquo; said Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can't make the gentleman believe in the everlasting slowness of that
      mule of mine, my story ain't worth a hill of beans,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The extraordinary slowness of the mule is accepted without question, Mr.
      Yancy,&rdquo; said Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm obliged to you,&rdquo; rejoined Yancy, and for a brief moment he appeared
      to commune with himself, then he continued. &ldquo;A mile out of town I heard
      some one sloshing through the rain after me; it was dark by that time and
      I couldn't see who it was, so I pulled up and waited, and then I made out
      it was a woman. She spoke when she was alongside the cart and says, 'Can
      you drive me on to the Barony?' and it came to me it was the same woman
      I'd seen leave the stage. When I got down to help her into the cart I saw
      she was toting a child in her arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the woman look like, Bob?&rdquo; said Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wa'n't exactly old and she wa'n't young by no manner of means; I
      remember saying to myself, that child ain't yo's, whose ever it is. Well,
      sir, I was willing enough to talk, but she wa'n't, she hardly spoke until
      we came to the red gate, when she says, 'Stop, if you please, I'll walk
      the rest of the way.' Mind you, she'd known without a word from me we were
      at the Barony. She give me a dollar, and the last I seen of her she was
      hurrying through the rain toting the child in her arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crenshaw took up the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The niggers say the old general almost had a fit when he saw her. Aunt
      Alsidia let her into the house; I reckon if Joe had been alive she
      wouldn't have got inside that door, spite of the night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When morning come she was gone, but the child done stayed behind; we
      always reckoned the lady walked back to Fayetteville sometime befo' day
      and took the stage. I've heard Aunt Alsidia tell as how the old general
      said that morning, pale and shaking like, 'You'll find a boy asleep in the
      red room; he's to be fed and cared fo', but keep him out of my sight. His
      name is Hannibal Wayne Hazard.' That is all the general ever said on the
      matter. He never would see the boy, never asked after him even, and the
      boy lived in the back of the house, with the niggers to look after him.
      Now, sir, you know as much as we know, which is just next door to
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old general was borne across what had once been the west lawn to his
      resting-place in the neglected acre where the dead and gone of his race
      lay, and the record of the family was complete, as far as any man knew.
      Crenshaw watched the grave take shape with a melancholy for which he found
      no words, yet if words could have come from the mist of ideas in which his
      mind groped vaguely he would have said that for themselves the deeds of
      the Quintards had been given the touch of finality, and that whether for
      good or for evil, the consequences, like the ripple which rises from the
      surface of placid waters when a stone is dropped, still survived somewhere
      in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curious and the idle drifted back to the great house; then the memory
      of their own affairs, not urgent, generally speaking, but still of some
      casual interest, took them down the disused carriage-way to the red gate
      and so off into the heat of the summer day. Crenshaw's wagon, driven by
      Crenshaw's man, vanished in a cloud of gray dust with the two old slaves,
      Aunt Alsidia and Uncle Ben, who were being taken to the Crenshaw place to
      be cared for pending the settlement of the Quintard estate. Bladen parted
      from Crenshaw with expressions of pleasure at having had the opportunity
      of making his acquaintance, and further delivered himself of the civil
      wish that they might soon meet again. Then Crenshaw, assisted by Bob
      Yancy, proceeded to secure the great house against intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make it a p'int to always stay and see the plumb finish of a thing,&rdquo;
       explained Yancy. &ldquo;Otherwise you're frequently put out by hearing of what
      happened after you left; I can stand anything but disapp'intment of that
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed from room to room securing doors and windows, and at last
      stepped out upon the back porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Yancy, pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There on a bench by the kitchen door was a small figure. It was Hannibal
      Wayne Hazard asleep, with his old spo'tin' rifle across his knees. His
      very existence had been forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare to goodness!&rdquo; said Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do with him, Mr. John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question nettled Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know as that is any particular affair of mine,&rdquo; he said. Now, Mr.
      Crenshaw, though an excellent man of business, with an unblinking eye on
      number one, was kindly, on the whole, but there was a Mrs. Crenshaw, to
      whom he rendered a strict account of all his deeds, and that sacred
      institution, the home, was only a tolerable haven when these deeds were
      nicely calculated to fit with the lady's exactions. Especially was he
      aware that Mrs. Crenshaw was averse to children as being inimical to
      cleanliness and order, oppressive virtues that drove Crenshaw himself in
      his hours of leisure to the woodshed, where he might spit freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you'd rather drop a word with yo' missus before you toted him
      home?&rdquo; suggested Yancy, who knew something of the nature of his friend's
      domestic thraldom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman ought to be boss in her own house,&rdquo; said Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feelin' the truth of that, I've never married, Mr. John; I do as I please
      and don't have to listen to a passel of opinion. But I was going to say,
      what's to hinder me from toting that boy to my home? There are no calico
      petticoats hanging up in my closets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no closets to hang 'em in, I'll be bound!&rdquo; rejoined Crenshaw. &ldquo;But if
      you'll take the boy, Bob, you shan't lose by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yancy rested a big knotted hand on the boy's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, wake up, sonny! Yo' Uncle Bob is ready fo' to strike out home,&rdquo; he
      said. The child roused with a start and stared into the strange bearded
      face that was bent toward him. &ldquo;It's yo' Uncle Bob,&rdquo; continued Yancy in a
      wheedling tone. &ldquo;Are you the little nevvy what will help him to hook up
      that old blind mule of hisn? Here, give us the spo'tin' rifle to tote!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, where is Aunt Alsidia?&rdquo; asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yancy balanced the rifle on his great palm and his eyes assumed a
      speculative cast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what's to hinder us from loading this old gun, and firing this
      old gun, and hearing this old gun go-bang! Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's blue eyes grew wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the guns off in the woods?&rdquo; he asked, in a breathless whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the guns a body hears off in the woods, only louder&mdash;heaps
      louder,&rdquo; said Yancy. &ldquo;You fetch out his plunder, Mr. John,&rdquo; he added in a
      lower tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it now, please,&rdquo; the child cried, slipping off the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was expectin' fo' to hear you name me Uncle Bob, sonny; my little
      nevvies get almost anything they want out of me when they call me
      that-a-ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Uncle Bob, make it go bang!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come along, then,&rdquo; and Mr. Yancy moved off in the direction of his
      mule, the child following. &ldquo;Powder's what we want fo' to make this old
      spo'tin' rifle talk up, and I reckon we'll find some in a horn flask in
      the bottom of my cart.&rdquo; His expectations in this particular were realized,
      and he loaded the rifle with a small blank charge. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, shaking
      the powder into the pan by a succession of smart taps on the breech,
      &ldquo;sometimes these old pieces go off and sometimes they don't; it depends on
      the flint, but you stand back of your Uncle Bob, sonny, and keep yo'
      fingers out of yo' ears, and when you say&mdash;bang!&mdash;off she goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of delightful expectancy, and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bang!&rdquo; cried the child, and on the instant the rifle cracked. &ldquo;Do it
      again! Please, Uncle Bob!&rdquo; he cried, wild with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now if you was to help yo' Uncle Bob hook up that old mule of hisn and
      ride home with him, fo' he's going pretty shortly, you and Uncle Bob could
      do right much shootin' with this old rifle.&rdquo; Mr. Crenshaw had appeared
      with a bundle, which he tossed into the cart. Yancy turned to him. &ldquo;If you
      meet any inquiring friends, Mr. John, I reckon you may say that my nevvy's
      gone fo' to pay me a visit. Most of his time will be agreeably spent
      shootin' with this rifle at a mark, and me holdin' him so he won't get
      kicked clean off his feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter beguiling speech flowed steadily from Mr. Yancy's bearded lips,
      in the midst of which relations were established between the mule and
      cart, and the boy quitted the Barony for a new world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you reckon if Uncle Bob was to let you, you could drive, sonny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can she gallop?&rdquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Yancy gave him a hurt glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's too much of a lady to do that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No, I 'low this ain't 'so
      fast as running or walking, but it's a heap quicker than standing
      stock-still.&rdquo; The afternoon sun waned as they went deeper and deeper into
      the pine woods, but at last they came to their journey's end, a widely
      scattered settlement on a hill above a branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Mr. Yancy, &ldquo;are Scratch Hill, sonny. Why Scratch Hill? Some
      say it's the fleas; others agin hold it's the eternal bother of making a
      living here, but whether fleas or living you scratch fo' both.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. YANCY TELLS A MORAL TALE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the deep peace that rested like a benediction on the pine-clad slopes
      of Scratch Hill the boy Hannibal followed at Yancy's heels as that
      gentleman pursued the not arduous rounds of temperate industry which made
      up his daily life, for if Yancy were not completely idle he was
      responsible for a counterfeit presentment of idleness having most of the
      merits of the real article. He toiled casually in a small cornfield and a
      yet smaller truck patch, but his work always began late, when it began at
      all, and he was easily dissuaded from continuing it; indeed, his attitude
      toward it seemed to challenge interference.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the winter, when the weather conditions were perfectly adjusted to meet
      certain occult exactions he had come to require, Yancy could be induced to
      go into the woods and there labor with his ax. But as he pointed out to
      Hannibal, a poor man's capital was his health, and he being a poor man it
      behooved him to have a jealous care of himself. He made use of the dull
      days of mingled mist and drizzle for hunting, work being clearly out of
      the question; one could get about over the brown floor of the forest in
      silence then, and there was no sun to glint the brass mountings of his
      rifle. The fine days he professed to regard with keen suspicion as weather
      breeders, when it was imprudent to go far from home, especially in the
      direction of the Crenshaw timber lands, which for years had been the scene
      of all his gainful industry, and where he seemed to think nature ready to
      assume her most sinister aspect. Again in the early spring, when the young
      oak leaves were the size of squirrel's ears and the whippoorwills began
      calling as the long shadows struck through the pine woods, the needs of
      his corn ground battled with his desire to fish. In all such crises of the
      soul Mr. Yancy was fairly vanquished before the struggle began; but to the
      boy his activities were perfectly ordered to yield the largest return in
      contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barony had been offered for sale and bought in by Crenshaw for eleven
      thousand dollars, this being the amount of his claim. Some six months
      later he sold the plantation for fifteen thousand dollars to Nathaniel
      Ferris, of Currituck County.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's money in the old place, Bob, at that figure,&rdquo; Crenshaw told
      Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are so,&rdquo; agreed Yancy, who was thinking Crenshaw had lost no time
      in getting it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seated on the counter in Crenshaw's store at Balaam's Cross
      Roads, where the heavy odor of black molasses battled with the sprightly
      smell of salt fish. The merchant held the Scratch Hiller in no small
      esteem. Their intimacy was of long standing, for the Yancys going down and
      the Crenshaws coming up had for a brief space flourished on the same
      social level. Mr. Crenshaw's rise in life, however, had been
      uninterrupted, while Mr. Yancy, wrapped in a philosophic calm and deeply
      averse to industry, had permitted the momentum imparted by a remote
      ancestor to carry him where it would, which was steadily away from that
      tempered prosperity his family had once boasted as members of the
      land-owning and slaveholding class.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean there's money in the place fo' Ferris,&rdquo; Crenshaw explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon yo're right, Mr. John; the old general used to spend a heap on
      the Barony and we all know he never got a cent back, so I reckon the
      money's there yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bladen's got an answer from them South Carolina Quintards, and they don't
      know nothing about the boy,&rdquo; said Crenshaw, changing the subject. &ldquo;So you
      can rest easy, Bob; they ain't going to want him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, that surely is a passel of comfort to me. I find I got all the
      instincts of a father without having had none of the instincts of a
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A richer, deeper realization of his joy came to Yancy when he had turned
      his back on Balaam's Cross Roads and set out for home through the fragrant
      silence of the pine woods. His probable part in the young life chance had
      placed in his keeping was a glorious thing to the man. He had not cared to
      speculate on the future; he had believed that friends or kindred must
      sooner or later claim Hannibal, but now he felt wonderfully secure in
      Crenshaw's opinion that this was not to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just beyond the Barony, which was midway between Balaam's and the Hill,
      down the long stretch of sandy road he saw two mounted figures, then as
      they drew nearer he caught the flutter of skirts and recognized one of the
      horsewomen. It was Mrs. Ferris, wife of the Barony's new owner. She reined
      in her horse abreast of his cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you Mr. Yancy?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, that's me&mdash;Bob Yancy.&rdquo; He regarded her with large gray
      eyes that were frankly approving in their expression, for she was more
      than commonly agreeable to look upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mrs. Ferris, and I am very pleased to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same here,&rdquo; murmured Yancy with winning civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferris' companion leaned forward, her face averted, and stroked her
      horse's neck with gloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my friend, Miss Betty Malroy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to know you, ma'am,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Malroy faced him, smiling. She, too, was very good to look upon,
      indeed she was quite radiant with youth and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are just returning from Scratch Hill&mdash;I think that is what you
      call it?&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we do,&rdquo; agreed Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the dear little boy we met is your nephew, is he not, Mr. Yancy?&rdquo; It
      was Betty Malroy who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a manner he is and in a manner he ain't,&rdquo; explained Yancy, somewhat
      enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are quite a number of children at Scratch Hill?&rdquo; suggested Mrs.
      Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, so there are; a body would naturally notice that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no school&mdash;not a church even!&rdquo; continued Mrs. Ferris in a
      grieved tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never has been,&rdquo; rejoined Yancy cheerfully. He seemed to champion the
      absence of churches and schools on the score of long usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do the people do when they want to go to church?&rdquo; questioned
      Mrs. Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never having heard that any of 'em wanted to go I can't say just offhand,
      but don't you fret none about that, ma'am; there are churches; one's up at
      the Forks, and there's another at Balaam's Cross Roads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's ten miles from Scratch Hill, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all of that,&rdquo; said Yancy. He sensed it that the lady before him, was
      a person of much force and energy, capable even of reckless innovation.
      Mr. Yancy himself was innately conservative; his religious inspiration had
      been drawn from the Forks and Balaam's Cross Roads. It had seemed to
      answer very well. Mrs. Ferris fixed his wavering glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think it is too bad, Mr. Yancy, the way those children have
      been neglected? There is nothing for them but to run wild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I seen some right good children fetched up that-a-ways&mdash;smart,
      too. You see, ma'am, there's a heap a child can just naturally pick up of
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and the monosyllable was uttered rather weakly. Mr. Yancy's name had
      been given her as that of a resident of weight and influence in the
      classic region of Scratch Hill. Miss Malroy came to her friend's rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Ferris thinks the children should have a chance to learn at home.
      Poor little tots!&mdash;they can't walk ten or fifteen miles to
      Sunday-school, now can they, Mr. Yancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless yo' heart, they won't try to!&rdquo; said Yancy reassuringly. &ldquo;Sunday's a
      day of rest at Scratch Hill. So are most of the other days of the week,
      but we all aspire to take just a little mo' rest on Sunday than any other
      day. Sometimes we ain't able to, but that's our aim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the old deserted cabin by the big pine?&mdash;the Blount
      place?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Ferris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to have Sunday-school there for those children; they shan't be
      neglected any longer if I can help it&mdash;I should feel guilty, quite
      guilty! Now won't you let your little nephew come? Perhaps they'll not
      find it so very terrible, after all.&rdquo; From which Mr. Yancy concluded that
      when she invaded it, skepticism had rested as a mantle on Scratch Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one said we would better talk with you, Mr. Yancy, and we were
      hoping to meet you as we came along,&rdquo; supplemented Miss Malroy, and her
      words of flattery were wafted to him with so sweet a smile that Yancy
      instantly capitulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you-all can count on my nevvy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached Scratch Hill, in the waning light of day, Hannibal, in a
      state of high excitement, met him at the log shed, which served as a barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you-all have been entertaining visitors while Uncle Bob was away,&rdquo;
       observed Yancy, and remembering what Crenshaw had told him, he rested his
      big hand on the boy's head with a special tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's going to be a school in the cabin in the old field!&rdquo; said the
      boy. &ldquo;May I go?&mdash;Oh, Uncle Bob, will you please take me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When's this here school going to begin, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow at four o'clock, she said, Uncle Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a quick lady, ain't she? Well, I expected you'd be hopping around
      on one leg when you named it to me. You wait until Sunday and see what I
      do fo' my nevvy,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was as good as his implied promise, but the day began discouragingly
      with an extra and, as it seemed to Hannibal, an unnecessary amount of soap
      and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You owe it to yo'self to show a clean skin in the house of worship. Just
      suppose one of them nice ladies was to cast her eye back of yo' ears!
      She'd surely be put out to name it offhand whether you was black or white.
      I reckon I'll have to barber you some, too, with the shears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's school like, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; asked Hannibal, twisting and squirming
      under the big resolute hands of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't just say what it's like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, didn't you ever go to school, Uncle Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I ever go to school! Where do you reckon I got my education,
      anyhow? I went to school several times in my young days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a Sunday, like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the school I tackled was on a week-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it hard?&rdquo; asked Hannibal, who was beginning to cherish secret
      misgivings; for surely all this soap and water must have some sinister
      portent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, some learn easier than others. I learned middling easy&mdash;it
      didn't take me long&mdash;and when I felt I knowed enough I just naturally
      quit and went on about my business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did you learn?&rdquo; insisted the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You-all wouldn't know if I told you, because you-all ain't ever been to
      school yo'self. When you've had yo' education we'll talk over what I
      learned&mdash;it mostly come out of a book.&rdquo; He hoped his general
      statement would satisfy Hannibal, but it failed to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's a book. Uncle Bob?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whatever a body don't know naturally he gets out of a book. I
      reckon the way you twist, Nevvy, mebby you'd admire fo' to lose an ear!&rdquo;
       and Mr. Yancy refused further to discuss the knowledge he had garnered in
      his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal and Yancy were the first to arrive at the deserted cabin in the
      old field that afternoon. They found the place had been recently cleaned
      and swept, while about the wall was ranged a row of benches; there was
      also a table and two chairs. Yancy inspected the premises with the eye of
      mature experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it surely is a school; any one with an education would know that.
      Just look!&mdash;ain't you glad yo' Uncle Bob slicked you up some, now you
      see what them ladies has done fo' to make this place tidy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shy children from the pine woods, big brothers with little sisters and big
      sisters with little brothers, drifted out of the encircling forest.
      Coincident with the arrival of the last of these stragglers Mrs. Ferris
      and Miss Malroy appeared, attended by a colored groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so good of you to come, Mr. Yancy! The children won't feel so shy
      with you here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ferris warmly, as Yancy assisted her to
      dismount, an act of courtesy that called for his finest courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferris' missionary spirit manifested itself agreeably enough on the
      whole. When she had ranged her flock in a solemn-faced row on the benches,
      she began by explaining why Sunday was set apart for a day of rest,
      touching but lightly on its deeper significance as a day of worship as
      well; then she read certain chapters from the Bible, finishing with the
      story of David, a narrative that made a deep impression upon Yancy,
      comfortably seated in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you tell the children a story, Mr. Yancy? Something about their own
      neighborhood I think would be nice, something with a moral,&rdquo; the pleasant
      earnest voice f Mrs. Ferris roused the Scratch Hiller from his
      meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, I reckon I can tell 'em a story.&rdquo; He stood up, filling the
      doorway with his bulk. &ldquo;I can tell you-all a story about this here house,&rdquo;
       he said, addressing himself to the children. He smiled happily. &ldquo;You-all
      don't need to look so solemn, a body ain't going to snap at you! This
      house are the old Blount cabin, but the Blounts done moved away from it
      years and years ago. They're down Fayetteville way now. There was a passel
      of 'em and they was about as common a lot of white folks as you'd find
      anywhere; I know, because I come to a dance here once and Dave Blount
      called me a liar right in this very room.&rdquo; He paused, that this impressive
      fact might disseminate itself. Hannibal slid forward in his seat, his
      earnest little face bent on Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he call you a liar, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I scarcely know, Nevvy, but that's what he done, and he stuck some
      words in front of it that ain't fitten I should repeat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Malroy's cheeks had become very red, and Mrs. Ferris refused to meet
      her eye, while the children were in a flutter of pleased expectancy. They
      felt the wholly contemporary interest of Yancy's story; he was dealing
      with forms of speech which prevailed and were usually provocative of
      consequences more or less serious. He gave them a wide, sunny smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Dave Blount called me that, I struck out fo' home.&rdquo; At this
      surprising turn in the narrative the children looked their disgust, and
      Mrs. Ferris shot Betty a triumphant glance. &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, I struck out
      across the fields fo' home, I didn't wish to hear no mo' of that loose
      kind of talk. When I got home I found my old daddy setting up afo' the
      fire, and he says, 'You come away early, son.' I told him what Dave Blount
      had called me and he says, 'You acted like a gentleman, Bob, with all them
      womenfolks about.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a very good and sensible father, Mr. Yancy. How much better than
      if&mdash;&rdquo; began Mrs. Ferris, who feared that the moral might elude him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, but along about day he come into the loft where I was
      sleeping and says to me, 'Sun-up, Bob&mdash;time fo' you to haul on yo'
      pants and go back yonder and fetch that Dave Blount a smack in the jaw.'&rdquo;
       Mrs. Ferris moved uneasily in her chair: &ldquo;I dressed and come here, but
      when I asked fo' Dave he wouldn't step outside, so I just lost patience
      with his foolishness and took a crack at him standing where I'm standing
      now, but he ducked and you can still see, ma'am&rdquo;&mdash;turning to the
      embarrassed Mrs. Ferris&mdash;&ldquo;where my knuckles made a dint in the
      door-jamb. I got him the next lick, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Yancy's moral tale had reached its conclusion; it was not for him to
      boast unduly of his prowess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob, you lift me up and show me them dints!&rdquo; and Hannibal slipped
      from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said Betty Malroy laughing. She captured the boy and drew him
      down beside her on a corner of her chair. &ldquo;I am sure you don't want to see
      the dents&mdash;Mr. Yancy's story, children, is to teach us how important
      it is to guard our words&mdash;and not give way to hasty speech&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Ferris indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judith, the moral is as obvious as it is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferris gave her a reproachful look and turned to the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will all be here next Sunday, won't you?&mdash;and at the same hour?&rdquo;
       she said, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden clatter of hoofs beyond the door. A man, well dressed
      and well mounted had ridden into the yard. As Mrs. Ferris came from the
      cabin he flung himself out of the saddle and, hat in hand, approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am hunting a place called the Barony; can you tell me if I am on the
      right road?&rdquo; he asked. He was a man in the early thirties, graceful and
      powerful of build, with a handsome face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my husband you wish to see? I am Mrs. Ferris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then General Quintard is dead?&rdquo; His tone was one of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His death occurred over a year ago, and my husband now owns the Barony;
      were you a friend of the general's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Madam; he was my father's friend, but I had hoped to meet him.&rdquo; His
      manner was adroit and plausible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ferris hesitated. The stranger's dress and bearing was that of a
      gentleman, and he could boast of his father's friendship with General
      Quintard. Any doubts she may have had she put aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you ride on with us to the Barony and meet my husband, Mr.&mdash;?&rdquo;
       she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murrell&mdash;Captain Murrell. Thank you; I should like to see the old
      place. I should highly value the privilege,&rdquo; then his eyes rested on Miss
      Malroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty, let me present Captain Murrell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain bowed, giving her a glance of bold admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the children had straggled off into the pine woods as
      silently as they had assembled; only Yancy and Hannibal remained. Mrs.
      Ferris turned to the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will close the cabin door, Mr. Yancy, everything will be ready for
      next Sunday,&rdquo; she said, and moved toward the horses, followed by Murrell.
      Betty Malroy lingered for a moment at Hannibal's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, little boy; you must ask your Uncle Bob to bring you up to the
      big house to see me,&rdquo; and stooping she kissed him. &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Yancy, I
      liked your story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal and Yancy watched them mount and ride away, then the boy said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob, now them ladies have gone, won't you please show me them dints
      you made in the doorjamb?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. TROUBLE AT SCRATCH HILL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Captain Murrell had established himself at Balaam's Cross Roads. He was
      supposed to be interested in the purchase of a plantation, and in company
      with Crenshaw visited the numerous tracts of land which the merchant
      owned; but though he professed delight with the country, he was plainly in
      no haste to become committed to any one of the several propositions
      Crenshaw was eager to submit. Later, and still in the guise of a
      prospective purchaser, he met Bladen, who also dealt extensively in land,
      and apparently if anything could have pleased him more than the region
      about the Cross Roads it was the country adjacent to Fayetteville.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first he had assiduously cultivated his acquaintance with the new
      owners of the Barony. He was now on the best of terms with Nat Ferris, and
      it was at the Barony that he lounged away his evenings, gossiping and
      smoking with the planter on the wide veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Barony would have suited me,&rdquo; he told Bladen one day. They had just
      returned from an excursion into the country and were seated in the
      lawyer's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say your father was a friend of the old general's?&rdquo; said Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years ago, in the north&mdash;yes,&rdquo; answered Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd, isn't it, the way he chose to spend the last years of his life, shut
      off like that and seeing no one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murrell regarded the lawyer in silence for a moment out of his deeply sunk
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too bad about the boy,&rdquo; he said at length slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean, Captain?&rdquo; asked Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean it's a pity he has no one except Yancy to look after him,&rdquo; said
      Murrell, but Bladen showed no interest and Murrell went on. &ldquo;Don't you
      reckon he must have touched General Quintard's life mighty close at some
      point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if so, it eluded me,&rdquo; said Bladen. &ldquo;I went through General
      Quintard's papers and they contained no clue to the boy's identity that I
      could discover. Fact is, the general didn't leave much beyond an old
      account-book or two; I imagine that before his death he destroyed the bulk
      of his private papers; it looked as if he'd wished to break with the past.
      His mind must have been affected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Yancy any legal claim on the boy?&rdquo; inquired Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not; the boy was merely left with Yancy because Crenshaw
      didn't know what else to do with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get possession of him, and if I don't buy land here I'll take him West
      with me,&rdquo; said Murrell quietly. Bladen gave him a swift, shrewd glance,
      but Murrell, smiling and easy, met it frankly. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it's a
      pity he should grow up wild in the pine woods&mdash;get him away from
      Yancy&mdash;I am' willing to spend five hundred dollars on this if
      necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of sentiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bladen considered. He was not averse to making five hundred dollars, but
      he was decidedly averse to letting slip any chance to secure a larger sum.
      It flashed in upon him that Murrell had uncovered the real purpose of his
      visit to North Carolina; his interest in land had been merely a
      subterfuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to think your proposition over,&rdquo; said Bladen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate result of this conversation was that within twenty-four
      hours a man driving two horses hitched to a light buggy arrived at Scratch
      Hill in quest of Bob Yancy, whom he found at dinner and to whom he
      delivered a letter. Mr. Yancy was profoundly impressed by the attention,
      for holding the letter at arm's length, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I've lived nigh on to forty years, but I never got a piece of
      writing befo'&mdash;never, sir. People, if they was close by, spoke to me,
      if at a distance they hollered, but none of 'em ever wrote.&rdquo; After gazing
      at the written characters with satisfaction Mr. Yancy made a taper of the
      letter and lit his pipe, which he puffed meditatively. &ldquo;Sonny, when you
      grow up you must learn so you can send writings to yo' Uncle Bob fo' him
      to light his pipe with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was in the paper, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; asked Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writin',&rdquo; said Mr. Yancy, and smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the writin' say, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; insisted the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was private,&rdquo; said Mr. Yancy, &ldquo;very private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your answer?&rdquo; demanded the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's private, too,&rdquo; said Mr. Yancy. &ldquo;You tell him I'll be monstrous
      glad to talk it over with him any time he fancies to come out here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said something about some one I was to carry back with me,&rdquo; objected
      the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bladen did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's a body to know who yore talking about unless you name him?&rdquo; said
      Yancy severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what am I to tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a free country and I got no call to dictate. You-all can tell him
      whatever you like.&rdquo; Further than this Mr. Yancy would not commit himself,
      and the man went as he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Yancy had occasion to visit Balaam's Cross Roads. Ordinarily
      Hannibal would have gone with him, but he was engaged in digging out a
      groundhog's hole with Oglethorpe Bellamy, grandson of Uncle Sammy Bellamy,
      the patriarch of Scratch Hill. Mr. Yancy forbore to interrupt this
      enterprise which he considered of some educational value, since the
      ground-hog's hole was an old one and he was reasonably certain that a
      family of skunks had taken possession of it. When Yancy reached the Cross
      Roads, Crenshaw gave him a disquieting opinion as to the probable contents
      of his letter, for he himself had heard from Bladen that he had decided to
      assume the care of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you reckon it was that&mdash;&rdquo; said Yancy, with a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a blame outrage, Bob, fo' him to act like this!&rdquo; said the merchant
      with heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you reckon he's going to send fo' him?&rdquo; asked Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever the notion strikes him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about my having notions too?&rdquo; inquired Yancy, flecked into passion,
      and bringing his fist down on the counter with a crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely ain't going to oppose him, Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he say when he's going to send fo' my nevvy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says it will be soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take care of my mule, Mr. John,&rdquo; said Yancy, and turned his back on
      his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon Bladen will have the law on his side, Bob!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law be damned&mdash;I got what's fair on mine, I don't wish fo'
      better than that,&rdquo; exclaimed Yancy, over his shoulder. He strode from the
      store and started down the sandy road at a brisk run. Miserable
      forebodings of an impending tragedy leaped up within him, and the miles
      were many that lay between him and the Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll just naturally bust the face off the fellow Bladen sends!&rdquo; thought
      Crenshaw, staring after his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      That run of Bob Yancy's was destined to become a classic in the annals of
      the neighborhood. Ordinarily a man walking briskly might cover the
      distance between the Cross Roads and the Hill in two hours. He
      accomplished it in less than an hour, and before he reached the branch
      that flowed a full quarter of a mile from his cabin he was shouting
      Hannibal's name as he ran. Then as he breasted the slope he came within
      sight of a little group in his own dooryard. Saving only Uncle Sammy
      Bellamy, the group resolved itself into the women and children of the
      Hill, but there was one small figure he missed, and the color faded from
      his cheeks while his heart stood still. The patriarch hurried toward him,
      leaning on his cane, while his grandson clung to the skirts of his coat,
      weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've took your nevvy, Bob!&rdquo; he cried, in a high, thin voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's took him?&rdquo; asked Yancy hoarsely. He paused and glanced from one to
      another of the little group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit were Dave Blount. Get your gun, Bob, and go after him&mdash;kill the
      miserable sneaking cuss!&rdquo; cried Uncle Sammy, who believed in settling all
      difficulties by bloodshed as befitted a veteran of the first war with
      England, he having risen to the respectable rank of sergeant in a company
      of Morgan's riflemen; while at sixty-odd in '12, when there was recruiting
      at the Cross Roads, his son had only been able to prevent his tendering
      his services to his country by hiding his trousers. &ldquo;Fetch his rifle, some
      of you fool women!&rdquo; cried Uncle Sammy. &ldquo;By the Fayetteville Road, Bob, not
      ten minutes ago&mdash;you can cut him off at Ox Road forks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yancy breathed a sigh of relief. The situation was not entirely desperate,
      for, as Uncle Sammy said, he could reach the Ox Road forks before Blount
      possibly could, by going as the crow flies through the pine woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit wouldn't have happened if there'd been a man on the Hill, but there
      was nothing but a passel of women about the place. I heard the boys crying
      when Dave Blount lifted your nevvy into the buggy,&rdquo; said Uncle Sammy; &ldquo;all
      I could do was to cuss him across two fields. I hope you blow his hide
      full of holes!&rdquo; for a rifle had been placed in Yancy's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you-all kindly,&rdquo; said Yancy, and turning away he struck off through
      the pine woods. A brisk walk of twenty minutes brought him to the Ox Road
      forks, as it was called, where he could plainly distinguish the wheel and
      hoof marks left by the buggy and team as it went to Scratch Hill, but
      there was only the single track.
    </p>
    <p>
      This important point being settled, sense of sweet peace stole in upon
      Yancy's spirit. He stood his rifle against a tree, lit his pipe with flint
      and steel, and rested comfortably by the wayside. He had not long to wait,
      for presently the buggy hove in sight; whereupon he coolly knocked the
      ashes from his pipe, pocketed it, and prepared for action. As the buggy
      came nearer he recognized his ancient enemy in the person of the man who
      sat at Hannibal's side, and stepping nimbly into the road seized the
      horses by their bits. At sight of him Hannibal shrieked his name in an
      ecstasy of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob&mdash;Uncle Bob&mdash;&rdquo; he, cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's Uncle Bob. You can light down, Nevvy. I reckon you've rid far
      enough,&rdquo; said Yancy pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leggo them horses!&rdquo; said Mr. Blount, recovering somewhat from the effect
      of Yancy's sudden appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light down, Nevvy,&rdquo; said Yancy, still pleasantly. Blount turned to the
      boy as if to interfere. &ldquo;Don't you put the weight of yo' finger on the
      boy, Blount!&rdquo; warned Yancy. &ldquo;Light down, Hannibal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal instantly availed himself of the invitation. At the same moment
      Blount struck at Yancy with his whip and his horses reared wildly,
      thinking the blow meant for them. Seeing that the boy had reached the
      ground in safety, Yancy relaxed his hold on the team, which instantly
      plunged forward. Then as the buggy swept past him he made a dexterous grab
      at Blount and dragged him out over the wheels into the road, where, for
      the second time in his life, he proceeded to fetch Mr. Blount a smack in
      the jaw. This he followed up with other smacks variously distributed about
      his countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll sweat for this, Bob Yancy!&rdquo; cried Blount, as he vainly sought to
      fend off the blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sweating now&mdash;scandalous,&rdquo; said Mr. Yancy, taking his unhurried
      satisfaction of the other. Then with a final skilful kick he sent Mr.
      Blount sprawling. &ldquo;Don't let me catch you around these diggings again,
      Dave Blount, or I swear to God I'll be the death of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal rode home through the pine woods in triumph on his Uncle Bob's
      mighty shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get yo' ground-hog, Nevvy?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Yancy presently when
      they had temporarily exhausted the excitement of Hannibal's capture and
      recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It weren't a ground-hog, Uncle Bob&mdash;it were a skunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of that!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Yancy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. LAW AT BALAAM'S CROSS-ROADS
    </h2>
    <p>
      But Mr. Yancy was only at the beginning of his trouble. Three days later
      there appeared on the borders of Scratch Hill a lank gentleman armed with
      a rifle, while the butts of two pistols protruded from the depths of his
      capacious coat pockets. He made his presence known by whooping from the
      edge of the branch, and his whoops shaped themselves into the name of
      Yancy. It was Charley Balaam, old Squire Balaam's nephew. The squire lived
      at the crossroads to which his family had given its name, and dispensed
      the little law that found its way into that part of the county. The whoops
      finally brought Yancy to his cabin door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see you friendly, Bob Yancy?&rdquo; Balaam demanded with the lungs of a
      stentor, sheltering himself behind the thick bole of a sweetgum, for he
      observed that Yancy held his rifle in the crook of his arm and had no wish
      to offer his person as a target to the deadly aim of the Scratch Hiller
      who was famous for his skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you can, Charley Balaam, if you are friendly,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a family man, Bob, and I ask you candid, do you feel peevish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in particular,&rdquo; and Yancy put aside his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a-going to trust you, Bob,&rdquo; said Balaam. And forsaking the shelter of
      the sweetgum he shuffled up the slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Charley?&rdquo; asked Yancy, as they shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only just tolerable, Bob. You've been warranted&mdash;Dave Blount swore
      hit on to you.&rdquo; He displayed a sheet of paper covered with much writing
      and decorated with a large seal. Yancy viewed this formidable document
      with respect, but did not offer to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; he said mildly. Balaam scratched his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that hit's my duty to do that, Bob. Hit's my duty to serve
      it on to you. But I can tell you what's into hit, leavin' out the law&mdash;which
      don't matter nohow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Uncle Sammy's bent form emerged from the path that led
      off through the woods in the direction of the Bellamy cabin. With the
      patriarch was a stranger. Now the presence of a stranger on Scratch Hill
      was an occurrence of such extraordinary rarity that the warrant instantly
      became a matter of secondary importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy, Charley. Here, Bob Yancy, you shake hands with Bruce Carrington,&rdquo;
       commanded Uncle Sammy. At the name both Yancy and Balaam manifested a
      quickened interest. They saw a man in the early twenties, clean-limbed and
      broad-shouldered, with a handsome face and shapely head. &ldquo;Yes, sir, hit's
      a grandson of Tom Carrington that used to own the grist-mill down at the
      Forks. Yo're some sort of wild-hog kin to him, Bob&mdash;yo' mother was a
      cousin to old Tom. Her family was powerful upset at her marrying a Yancy.
      They say Tom cussed himself into a 'pleptic fit when the news was fetched
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you located at, Mr. Carrington?&rdquo; asked Yancy. But Carrington was
      not given a chance to reply. Uncle Sammy saved him the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back in Kentucky. He tells me he's been follerin' the water. What's the
      name of that place where Andy Jackson fit the British?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New Orleans,&rdquo; prompted Carrington good naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's hit&mdash;he takes rafts down the river to New Orleans, then he
      comes back on ships to Baltimore, or else he hoofs it no'th overland.&rdquo;
       Uncle Sammy had acquired a general knowledge of the stranger's habits and
      pursuits in an incredibly brief space of time. &ldquo;He wants to visit the
      Forks,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm shortly goin' that way myself, Mr. Carrington, and I'll be pleased of
      your company&mdash;but first I got to get through with Bob Yancy,&rdquo; said
      Balaam, and again he produced the warrant. &ldquo;If agreeable to you, Bob, I'll
      ask Uncle Sammy, as a third party friendly to both, to read this here
      warrant,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's been a-warrantin' Bob Yancy?&rdquo; cried Uncle Sammy, with shrill
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dave Blount has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knowed hit&mdash;I knowed he'd try to get even!&rdquo; And Uncle Sammy struck
      his walking-stick sharply on the packed earth of Yancy's dooryard. &ldquo;What's
      the charge agin you, Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read hit,&rdquo; said Balaam. &ldquo;Why, sho'&mdash;can't you read plain writin',
      Uncle Sammy?&rdquo; for the patriarch was showing signs of embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you gentlemen will let me&mdash;&rdquo; said Carrington pleasantly.
      Instantly there came a relieved chorus from the three in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would my spectacles help you any, Mr. Carrington?&rdquo; asked Uncle Sammy
      officiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They air powerful seein' glasses, and I'm aweer some folks read a heap
      easier with spectacles than without 'em.&rdquo; After a moment's scrutiny of the
      paper that Balaam had thrust in his hand, Carrington began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Sheriff of the County of Cumberland: Greetings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means me,&rdquo; explained Balaam. &ldquo;He always makes 'em out to the sheriff,
      but they are returned to me and I serve 'em.&rdquo; Carrington resumed his
      reading,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas, It is alleged that a murderous assault has been committed on one
      David Blount, of Fayetteville, by Robert Yancy, of Scratch Hill, said
      Blount sustaining numerous bruises and contusions, to his great injury of
      body and mind; and, whereas, it is further alleged that said murderous
      assault was wholly unprovoked and without cause, you will forthwith take
      into custody the person of said Yancy, of Scratch Hill, charged with
      having inflicted the bruises and contusions herein set forth in the
      complaint of said Blount, and instantly bring him into our presence to
      answer to these various and several crimes and misdemeanors. You are
      empowered to seize said Yancy wherever he may be at; whether on the
      hillside or in the valley, eating or sleeping, or at rest.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
           &ldquo;De Lancy Balaam, Magistrate.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourth District, County of Cumberland, State of North Carolina. Done this
      twenty-fourth day of May, 1835.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S. Dear Bob: Dave Blount says he ain't able to chew his meat. I thought
      you'd be glad to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smilingly Carrington folded the warrant and handed it to Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you goin' to do about hit, Bob?&rdquo; inquired Balaam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I'd ought to go. I'd like to oblige the squire,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does this here co't set?&rdquo; demanded Uncle Sammy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit don't do much else since he's took with the lumbago,&rdquo; answered Balaam
      somewhat obscurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are the squire, Charley?&rdquo; asked Yancy with grave concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only just tolerable, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he tell you to do?&rdquo; and Yancy knit his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems like he wanted me to find out what you'd do. He recommended I
      shouldn't use no violence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't recommend you did, either,&rdquo; assented Yancy, but without heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd get shut of this here law business, Bob,&rdquo; advised Uncle Sammy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I come to the Cross Roads this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's agreeable,&rdquo; said the deputy, who presently departed in company
      with Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours later the male population of Scratch Hill, with a gravity
      befitting the occasion, prepared itself to descend on the Cross Roads and
      give its support to Mr. Yancy in his hour of need. To this end those
      respectable householders armed themselves, with the idea that it might
      perhaps be necessary to correct some miscarriage of justice. They were shy
      enough and timid enough, these remote dwellers in the pine woods, but,
      like all wild things, when they felt they were cornered they were prone to
      fight; and in this instance it was clearly iniquitous that Bob Yancy's
      right to smack Dave Blount should be questioned. That denied what was left
      of human liberty. But beyond this was a matter of even greater importance:
      they felt that Yancy's possession of the boy was somehow involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yancy had declared himself simply but specifically on this point. Law or
      no law, he would kill whoever attempted to take the boy from him, and
      Scratch Hill believing to a man that in so doing he would be well within
      his rights, was prepared to join in the fray. Even Uncle Sammy, who had
      not been off the Hill in years, announced that no consideration of fatigue
      would keep him away from the scene of action and possible danger, and
      Yancy loaned him his mule and cart for the occasion. When the patriarch
      was helped to his seat in the ancient vehicle he called loudly for his
      rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, pap, what do you want with a weapon?&rdquo; asked his son indulgently. &ldquo;If
      there air shootin' I may take a hand in it. Now you-all give me a fair
      hour's start with this mule critter of Bob's, and if nothin' busts I'll be
      at the squire's as soon as the best of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Sammy was given the time allowance he asked and then Scratch Hill
      wended its way down the path to the branch and the highroad. Yancy led the
      straggling procession, with the boy trotting by his side, his little
      sunburned fist clasped in the man's great hand. He, too, was armed. He
      carried the old spo'tin' rifle he had brought from the Barony, and
      suspended from his shoulder by a leather thong was the big horn flask with
      its hickory stopper his Uncle Bob had fashioned for him, while a deerskin
      pouch held his bullets and an extra flint or two. He understood that
      beyond those smacks he had seen his Uncle Bob fetch Mr. Blount, he himself
      was the real cause of this excitement, that somebody, it was not plain to
      his mind just who, was seeking to get him away from Scratch Hill, and that
      a mysterious power called the Law would sooner or later be invoked to this
      dread end. But he knew this much clearly, nothing would induce him to
      leave his Uncle Bob! And his thin little fingers nestled warmly against
      the man's hardened palm. Yancy looked down and gave him a sunny,
      reassuring smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll be all right, Nevvy,&rdquo; he said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't let 'em take me, would you, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; asked the child in a
      fearful whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an idea ain't entered my head. And this here warranting is just some
      of Dave Blount's cussedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob, what'll they do to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon the squire'll feel obliged to do one of two things. He'll
      either fine me or else he won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll you do if he fines you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, pay the fine, Nevvy&mdash;and then lick Dave Blount again for
      stirring up trouble. That's the way we most in general do. I mean to say
      give him a good licking, and that'll make him stop his foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't that a good licking you gave him on the Ox Road, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; asked
      Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was pretty fair fo' a starter, but I'm capable of doing a better job,&rdquo;
       responded Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They overtook Uncle Sammy as he turned in at the squire's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I'd come and see what kind of law a body gets at this here co't
      of yours,&rdquo; the patriarch explained to Mr. Balaam, who, forgetting his
      lumbago, had hurried forth to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did you fetch your gun, Uncle Sammy?&rdquo; asked the magistrate,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit were to be on the safe side, Squire. Where air them Blounts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them Blounts don't need to bother you none. There air only Dave, and he
      can't more than half see out of one eye to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire's court held its infrequent sittings in the best room of the
      Balaam homestead, a double cabin of hewn logs. Here Scratch Hill was
      gratified with a view of Mr. Blount's battered visage, and it was conceded
      that his condition reflected creditably on Yancy's physical prowess and
      was of a character fully to sustain that gentleman's reputation; for while
      he was notoriously slow to begin a fight, he was reputed to be even more
      reluctant to leave off once he had become involved in one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this here fuss between you and Bob Yancy?&rdquo; demanded the squire
      when he had administered the oath to Blount. Mr. Blount's statement was
      brief and very much to the point. He had been hired by Mr. Bladen, of
      Fayetteville, to go to Scratch Hill and get the boy who had been
      temporarily placed in Yancy's custody at the time of General Quintard's
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop just there!&rdquo; cried the magistrate, leveling a pudgy finger at
      Blount. &ldquo;This here co't is already cognizant of certain facts bearing on
      that p'int. The boy was left with Bob Yancy mainly because nobody else
      would take him. Them's the facts. Now go on!&rdquo; he finished sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know what Bladen told me,&rdquo; said Blount sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon Mr. Bladen ought to feel obliged to tell the truth,&rdquo; said
      the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He done give me the order from the judge of the co't&mdash;I was to show
      it to Bob Yancy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got that order?&rdquo; demanded the squire sharply. With a smile, damaged, but
      clearly a smile, Blount produced the order. &ldquo;Hmm&mdash;app'inted guardeen
      of the boy&mdash;&rdquo; the squire was presently heard to murmur. The crowded
      room was very still now, and more than one pair of eyes were turned
      pityingly in Yancy's direction. When the long arm of the law reached out
      from Fayetteville, where there was a real judge and a real sheriff, it
      clothed itself with very special terrors. The boy looked up into Yancy's
      face. That tense silence had struck a chill through his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; whispered Yancy reassuringly, smiling down upon him. And
      Hannibal, comforted, smiled back, and nestled his head against his Uncle
      Bob's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Blount, what did you do with this here order?&rdquo; asked the
      squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went with it to Scratch Hill,&rdquo; said Blount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And showed it to Bob Yancy?&rdquo; asked the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he wa'n't there. But the boy was, and I took him in my buggy and
      drove off. I'd got as far as the Ox Road forks when I met Yancy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened then?&mdash;but a body don't need to ask! Looks like the
      law was all you had on your side!&rdquo; and the squire glanced waggishly about
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I showed Yancy the order&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, Dave Blount; you didn't!&rdquo; said Yancy. &ldquo;But I can't say as it
      would have made no difference, Squire. He'd have taken his licking just
      the same and I'd have had my nevvy out of that buggy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't he say nothing about this here order from the colt, Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wa'n't much conversation, Squire. I invited my nevvy to light down,
      and then I snaked Dave Blount out over the wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who struck the first blow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did. He struck at me with his buggy whip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you got to say to this, Mr. Blount?&rdquo; asked the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say I showed him the order like I said,&rdquo; answered Blount doggedly.
      Squire Balaam removed his spectacles and leaned back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the opinion of this here co't that the whole question of assault
      rests on whether Bob Yancy saw the order. Bob Yancy swears he didn't see
      it, while Dave Blount swears he showed it to him. If Bob Yancy didn't know
      of the existence of the order he was clearly actin' on the idea that
      Blount was stealin' his nevvy, and he done what any one would have done
      under the circumstances. If, on the other hand, he knowed of this order
      from the co't, he was not only guilty of assault, but he was guilty of
      resistin' an officer of the co't.&rdquo; The squire paused impressively. His
      audience drew a long breath. The impression prevailed that the case was
      going against Yancy, and more than one face was turned scowlingly on the
      fat little justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can a body drap a word here?&rdquo; It was Uncle Sammy's thin voice that cut
      into the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Uncle Sammy. This here co't will always admire to listen to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'd like to say that I consider that Fayetteville co't mighty
      officious with its orders. This part of the county won't take nothin' off
      Fayetteville! We don't interfere with Fayetteville, and blamed if we'll
      let Fayetteville interfere with us!&rdquo; There was a murmur of approval.
      Scratch Hill remembered the rifles in its hands and took comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fayetteville co't air a higher co't than this, Uncle Sammy,&rdquo;
       explained the squire indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm aweer of that,&rdquo; snapped the patriarch. &ldquo;I've seen hit's steeple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Air you finished, Uncle Sammy?&rdquo; asked the squire deferentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'low I am. But I 'low that if this here case is goin' agin Bob Yancy
      I'd recommend him to go home and not listen to no mo' foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Yancy will oblige this co't by setting still while I finish this
      case,&rdquo; said the squire with dignity. &ldquo;As I've already p'inted out, the
      question of veracity presents itself strongly to the mind of this here
      colt. Mr. Yancy has sworn to one thing, Mr. Blount to another. Now the
      Yancys air an old family in these parts; Mr. Blount's folks air strangers,
      but we don't know nothing agin them&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we don't know nothing in their favor,&rdquo; Uncle Sammy interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dave's grandfather came here from Virginia about fifty years back and
      settled near Scratch Hill&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never knowed why he left Virginia or why he came here,&rdquo; said Uncle
      Sammy, and knowing what local feeling was, was sure he had shot a telling
      bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, about twenty-five years ago Dave's father pulled up and went to
      Fayetteville. Nobody ever knowed why&mdash;and I don't remember that he
      ever offered any explanation&mdash;&rdquo; continued the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't&mdash;he just left,&rdquo; said Uncle Sammy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently,&rdquo; pursued the squire, somewhat vindictively, &ldquo;we ain't had
      any time in which to form an opinion of the Blounts; but for myself, I'm
      suspicious of folks that keep movin' about and who don't seem able to get
      located permanent nowheres, who air here to-day and away tomorrow. But you
      can't say that of the Yancys. They air an old family in the country, and
      naturally this co't feels obliged to accept a Yancy's word before the word
      of a stranger. And in view of the fact that the defendant did not seek
      litigation, but was perfectly satisfied to let matters rest where they
      was, it is right and just that all costs should fall on the plaintiff.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER V. THE ENCOUNTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Betty Malroy had ridden into the squire's yard during the progress of the
      trial and when Yancy and Hannibal came from the house she beckoned the
      Scratch Hiller to her. She was aware that Mr. Yancy, moving along the line
      of least industrial resistance, might be counted of little worth in any
      broad scheme of life. Nat Ferris had strongly insisted on this point, as
      had Judith, who shared her husband's convictions; consequently, the rumors
      of his present difficulty had merely excited them to adverse criticism.
      They had been sure the best thing that could happen the boy would be his
      removal from Yancy's guardianship, but this was not at all her conclusion.
      She considered Mr. Bladen heartless and his course without justification,
      and she regarded Yancy's affection for the boy as in itself constituting a
      benefit that quite outweighed his unprogressive example.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to lose your nephew, are you, Mr. Yancy?&rdquo; she asked
      eagerly, when Yancy stood at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am.&rdquo; But his sense of elation was plainly tempered by the
      knowledge that for him the future held more than one knotty problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad! I know Hannibal will be much happier with you than with
      any one else,&rdquo; and she smiled brightly at the boy, whose small sunburned
      face was upturned to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that-a-ways myself, Miss Betty, but this trial was only for my
      smacking Dave Blount, who was trying to steal my nevvy,&rdquo; explained Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you smacked him well and hard!&rdquo; said the girl, whose mood was
      warlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't got no cause to complain, thank you,&rdquo; returned Mr. Yancy
      pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rode out to the Hill to say good-by to Hannibal and to you, but they
      said you were here and that the trial was today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Murrell, with Crenshaw and the squire, came from the house, and
      Murrell's swarthy face lit up at sight of the girl. Yancy, sensible of the
      gulf that yawned between himself and what was known as &ldquo;the quality,&rdquo;
       would have yielded his place, but Betty detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going away, ma'am?&rdquo; he asked with concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;to my home in west Tennessee,&rdquo; and a cloud crossed her smooth
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That surely is a right big distance for you to travel, ma'am,&rdquo; said
      Yancy, his mind opening to this fresh impression. &ldquo;I reckon it's rising a
      hundred miles or mo',&rdquo; he concluded, at a venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's almost a thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of that! And you are that ca'm!&rdquo; cried Yancy admiringly, as a
      picture of simply stupendous effort offered itself to his mind's eye. He
      added: &ldquo;I am mighty sorry you are going. We-all here shall miss you&mdash;specially
      Hannibal. He just regularly pines for Sunday as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will miss me a little&mdash;I'm afraid I want him to!&rdquo; She
      glanced down at the boy as she spoke, and into her eyes, very clear and
      very blue and shaded by long dark lashes, stole a look of wistful
      tenderness. She noted how his little hand was clasped in Yancy's, she
      realized the perfect trust of his whole attitude toward this big bearded
      man, and she was conscious of a sudden feeling of profound respect for the
      Scratch Hiller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But ain't you ever coming back, Miss Betty?&rdquo; asked Hannibal rather
      fearfully, smitten with the awesome sense of impermanence which dogs our
      footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope so, dear&mdash;I wish to think so. But you see my home is not
      here.&rdquo; She turned to Yancy, &ldquo;So it is settled that he is to remain with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly, Miss Betty. You see, there's an order from the Fayetteville
      co't fo' me to give him up to this man Bladen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Uncle Bob says&mdash;&rdquo; began Hannibal, who considered his Uncle Bob's
      remarks on this point worth quoting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind what yo' Uncle Bob said,&rdquo; interrupted Yancy hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Yancy, you are not going to surrender him&mdash;no matter what
      the court says!&rdquo; cried Betty. The expression on Yancy's face was so grim
      and determined on the instant with the latent fire that was in him
      flashing from his eyes that she added quickly, &ldquo;You know the law is for
      you as well as for Mr. Bladen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I won't bother the law none,&rdquo; responded Yancy briefly. &ldquo;Me and
      my nevvy will go back to Scratch Hill and there won't be no trouble so
      long as they leave us be. But them Fayetteville folks want to keep away&mdash;&rdquo;
       The fierce light slowly died out of his eyes. &ldquo;It'll be all right, ma'am,
      and it's mighty good and kind of you fo' to feel the way you do. I'm
      obliged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Betty was by no means sure of the outcome Yancy seemed to predict with
      such confidence. Unless Bladen abandoned his purpose, which he was not
      likely to do, a tragedy was clearly pending for Scratch Hill. She saw the
      boy left friendless, she saw Yancy the victim of his own primitive
      conception of justice. Therefore she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you don't leave the Hill, Mr. Yancy. You could so easily go
      where Mr. Bladen would never find you. Haven't you thought of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That are a p'int,&rdquo; agreed Yancy slowly. &ldquo;Might I ask what parts you'd
      specially recommend?&rdquo; lifting his grave eyes to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would really be the sensible thing to do!&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;I am sure you
      would like West Tennessee&mdash;they say you are a great hunter.&rdquo; Yancy
      smiled almost guiltily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like a little spo't now and then yes, ma'am, I do hunt some,&rdquo; he
      admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Betty, Uncle Bob's the best shot we got! You had ought to see him
      shoot!&rdquo; said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Yancy, if you should cross the mountains, remember I live near
      Memphis. Belle Plain is the name of the plantation&mdash;it's not hard to
      find; just don't forget&mdash;Belle Plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't forget, and mebby you will see us there one of these days. Sho',
      I've seen mighty little of the world&mdash;about as far as a dog can trot
      it a couple of hours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think what it will mean to Hannibal if you become involved further
      with Mr. Bladen.&rdquo; Betty spoke earnestly, bending toward him, and Yancy
      understood the meaning that lay back of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've thought of that, too,&rdquo; the Scratch Hiller answered seriously. Betty
      glanced toward the squire and Mr. Crenshaw. They were standing near the
      bars that gave entrance to the lane. Murrell had left them and was walking
      briskly down the road toward Crenshaw's store where his horse was tied.
      She bent down and gave Yancy her slim white hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Yancy&mdash;lift Hannibal so that I can kiss him!&rdquo; Yancy
      swung the child aloft. &ldquo;I think you are such a nice little boy, Hannibal&mdash;you
      mustn't forget me!&rdquo; And touching her horse lightly with the whip she rode
      away at a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sho'ly is a lady!&rdquo; said Yancy, staring after her. &ldquo;And we mustn't
      forget Memphis or Belle Plain, Nevvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crenshaw and the squire approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said the merchant, &ldquo;Bladen's going to have the boy&mdash;but he
      made a mistake in putting this business in the hands of a fool like Dave
      Blount. I reckon he knows that now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon his next move will be to send a posse of gun-toters up from
      Fayetteville,&rdquo; said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what he'll do,&rdquo; agreed Crenshaw, and looked disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They certainly air an unpeaceable lot&mdash;them Fayetteville folks! It's
      always seemed to me they had a positive spite agin this end of the
      county,&rdquo; said the squire, and he pocketed his spectacles and refreshed
      himself with a chew of tobacco. &ldquo;Bladen ain't actin' right, Bob. It's a
      year and upwards since the old general 'died. He let you go on thinking
      the boy was to stay with you and now he takes a notion to have him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, it ain't right nor reasonable. And what's more, he shan't have
      him!&rdquo; said Yancy, and his tone was final.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what kind of a mess you're getting yourself into, Bob, I
      declare I don't!&rdquo; cried Crenshaw, who felt that he was largely responsible
      for the whole situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like your neighbors would stand by you,&rdquo; suggested the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want them to stand by me. It'll only get them into trouble, and I
      ain't going to do that,&rdquo; rejoined Yancy, and lapsed into momentary
      silence. Then he resumed meditatively, &ldquo;There was old Baldy Ebersole who
      shot the sheriff when they tried to arrest him for getting drunk down in
      Fayetteville and licking the tavern-keeper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho', there wa'n't no harm in Baldy!&rdquo; said the squire, with heat. &ldquo;When
      that sheriff come along here looking for him, I told him p'inted that
      Baldy said he wouldn't be arrested. A more truthful man I never knowed,
      and if the damn fool had taken my word he'd be living yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you-all know what trouble killing that sheriff made fo' Baldy!&rdquo; said
      Yancy. &ldquo;He told me often he regretted it mo' than anything he'd ever done.
      He said it was most aggravatin' having to always lug a gun wherever he
      went. And what with being suspicious of strangers when he wa'n't
      suspicious by nature, he reckoned in time it would just naturally wear him
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stood it until he was risin' eighty,&rdquo; said Crenshaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His, father lived to be ninety, John, and as spry an old gentleman as a
      body'd wish to see. I don't uphold no man for committing murder, but I do
      consider the sheriff should have waited on Baldy to get mo' reasonable,
      like he'd done in time if they'd just let him alone&mdash;but no, sir, he
      reckoned the law wa'n't no respecter of persons. He was a fine-appearin'
      man, that sheriff, and just elected to office. I remember we had to leave
      off the tail-gate to my cart to accommodate him. Yes, sir, they pretty
      near pestered Baldy into his grave&mdash;and seein' that pore old fellow
      pottering around year after year always toting a gun was the patheticest
      sight I most ever seen, and I made up my mind then if it ever seemed
      necessary for me to kill a man, I'd leave the county or maybe the state,&rdquo;
       concluded the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you reckon it would be some better to leave the state afo' you.
      done the killing?&rdquo; suggested Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a man might. I don't know but what he'd be justified in getting
      shut of his troubles like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Betty Malroy rode away from Squire Balaam's Murrell galloped after
      her. Presently she heard the beat of his horse's hoofs as he came pounding
      along the sandy road and glanced back over her shoulder. With an
      exclamation of displeasure she reined in her horse. She had not wished to
      ride to the Barony with him, yet she had no desire to treat him with
      discourtesy, especially as the Ferrises were disposed to like him. Murrell
      quickly gained a place at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Ferris is at the Barony?&rdquo; he said, drawing his horse down to a
      walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he is,&rdquo; said Betty with a curt little air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ride with you?&rdquo; he gave her a swift glance. She nodded
      indifferently and would have urged her horse into a gallop again, but he
      made a gesture of protest. &ldquo;Don't&mdash;or I shall think you are still
      running away from me,&rdquo; he said with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you at the trial?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I am glad they didn't get Hannibal
      away from Yancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Yancy will have his hands full with that later&mdash;so will Bladen,&rdquo;
       he added significantly. He studied her out of those deeply sunken eyes of
      his in which no shadow of youth lingered, for men such as he reached their
      prime early, and it was a swiftly passing splendor. &ldquo;Ferris tells me you
      are going to West Tennessee?&rdquo; he said at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your half-brother, Tom Ware&mdash;I know him very well.&rdquo; There was
      another brief silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you know Tom?&rdquo; she presently observed, and frowned slightly. Tom was
      her guardian, and her memories of him were not satisfactory. A burly,
      unshaven man with a queer streak of meanness through his character. She
      had not seen him since she had been sent north to Philadelphia, and their
      intercourse had been limited to infrequent letters. His always smelled of
      strong, stale tobacco, and the well-remembered whine in the man's voice
      ran through his written sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've spent much of your time up North?&rdquo; suggested Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four years. I've been at school, you know. That's where I met Judith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you'll like West Tennessee. It's still a bit raw compared with
      what you've been accustomed to in the North. You haven't been back in all
      those four years?&rdquo; Betty shook her head. &ldquo;Nor seen Tom&mdash;nor any one
      from out yonder?&rdquo; For some reason a little tinge of color had crept into
      Betty's cheeks. &ldquo;Will you let me renew our acquaintance at Belle Plain? I
      shall be in West Tennessee before the summer is over; probably I shall
      leave here within a week,&rdquo; he said, bending toward her. His glance dwelt
      on her face and the pliant lines of her figure, and his sense swam. Since
      their first meeting the girl's beauty had haunted and allured him; with
      his passionate sense of life he was disposed to these violent fancies, and
      he had a masterful way with women just as he had a masterful way with men.
      Now, however, he was aware that he was viewed with entire indifference.
      His vanity, which was his whole inner self, was hurt, and from the black
      depths of his nature his towering egotism flashed out lawless and
      perverted impulses. &ldquo;I must tell you that I am not of your sort, Miss
      Malroy&mdash;&rdquo; he continued hurriedly. &ldquo;My people were plain folk out of
      the mountains. For what I am I have no one to thank but myself. You must
      be aware of the prejudices of the planter class, for it is your class.
      Perhaps I haven't been quite frank at the Barony&mdash;I felt it was
      asking too much when you were there. That was a door I didn't want closed
      to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine you will be welcome at Belle Plain. You are Tom's friend.&rdquo;
       Murrell bit his lip, and then laughed as his mind conjured up a picture of
      the cherished Tom. Suddenly he reached out and rested his hand on hers. He
      lived in the shadow of chance not always kind, his pleasures were
      intoxicating drafts snatched in the midst of dangers, and here was youth,
      sweet and perfect, that only needed awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty&mdash;if I might think&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but his tongue stumbled.
      His love-making was usually of a savage sort, but some quality in the girl
      held him in check. The words he had spoken many times before forsook him.
      Betty drew away from him, an angry color on her cheeks and an angry light
      in her eyes. &ldquo;Forgive me, Betty!&rdquo; muttered Murrell, but his heart beat
      against his ribs, and passion sent its surges through him. &ldquo;Don't you know
      what I'm trying to tell you?&rdquo; he whispered. Betty gathered up her reins.
      &ldquo;Not yet&mdash;&rdquo; he cried, and again he rested a heavy hand on hers.
      &ldquo;Don't you know what's kept me here? It was to be near you&mdash;only that&mdash;I've
      been waiting for this chance to speak. It was long in coming, but it's
      here now&mdash;and it's mine!&rdquo; he exulted. His eyes burned with a luminous
      fire, he urged his horse nearer and they came to a halt. &ldquo;Look here&mdash;I'll
      follow you North&mdash;I swear I love you&mdash;say I may!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go&mdash;let me go!&rdquo; cried Betty indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not yet!&rdquo; he urged his horse still nearer and gathered her
      close. &ldquo;You've got to hear me. I've loved you since the first moment I
      rested my eyes on you&mdash;and, by God, you shall love me in return!&rdquo; He
      felt her struggle to free herself from his grasp with a sense of savage
      triumph. It was the brute force within him that conquered with women just
      as it conquered with men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce Carrington, on his way back to Fayetteville from the Forks, came
      about a turn in the road. Betty saw a tall, handsome fellow in the first
      flush of manhood; Carrington, an angry girl, very beautiful and very
      indignant, struggling in a man's grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the new-comer, Murrell, with an oath, released Betty, who,
      striking her horse with the whip galloped down the road toward the Barony.
      As she fled past Carrington she bent low in her saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let him follow me!&rdquo; she gasped, and Carrington, striding forward,
      caught Murrell's horse by the bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, you!&rdquo; he said coolly. The two men glared at each other for a
      brief instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your hand off my horse!&rdquo; exclaimed Murrell hoarsely, his mouth hot
      and dry with a sense of defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you see she'd rather be alone?&rdquo; said Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; roared Murrell, and a murderous light shot from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know but I should pull you out of that saddle and twist your
      neck!&rdquo; said Carrington hotly. Murrell's face underwent a swift change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a bold fellow to force your way into a lover's quarrel,&rdquo; he said
      quietly. Carrington's arm dropped at his side. Perhaps, after all, it was
      that. Murrell thrust his hand into his pocket. &ldquo;I always give something to
      the boy who holds my horse,&rdquo; he said, and tossed a coin in Carrington's
      direction. &ldquo;There&mdash;take that for your pains!&rdquo; he added. He pulled his
      horse about and rode back toward the cross-roads at an easy canter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington, with an angry flush on his sunburnt cheeks, stood staring down
      at the coin that glinted in the dusty road, but he was seeing the face of
      the girl, indignant, beautiful&mdash;then he glanced after Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I ought to have twisted his neck,&rdquo; he said with a deep breath.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. BETTY SETS OUT FOR TENNESSEE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bruce Carrington came of a westward-looking race. From the low coast where
      they had first settled, those of his name had followed the rivers to their
      headwaters. The headwaters had sent them forth toward the foot-hills,
      where they made their, clearings and built their cabins in the shadow of
      the blue wall that for a time marked the furthest goal of their desires.
      But only for a time. Crossing the mountains they found the headwaters once
      more, and following the streams out of the hills saw the roaring torrents
      become great placid rivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington's father had put the mountains at his back thirty years before.
      The Watauga settlements had furnished him a wife, and some four years
      later Bruce was born on the banks of the Ohio. The senior Carrington had
      appeared on horseback as a wooer, but had walked on foot as a married man,
      each shift of residence he made having represented a descent to a lower
      social level. On the death of his wife he had embarked in the river trade
      with all that enthusiasm and hope he had brought to half-a-dozen other
      occupations, for he was a gentleman of prodigious energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce's first memories had to do with long nights when he perched beside
      his father on the cabin roof of their keel-boat and watched the stars, or
      the blurred line of the shore where it lay against the sky, or the lights
      on other barges and rafts drifting as they were drifting, with their wheat
      and corn and whisky to that common market at the river's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes they dragged their boat back up-stream, painfully, laboriously;
      three or four months of unremitting toil sufficed for this, when the crew
      sweated at the towing ropes from dawn until dark, that the rich planters
      in Kentucky and Tennessee might have tea and wine for their tables, and
      silks and laces for their womenfolk. More often they abandoned their boat
      and tramped north, armed and watchful, since cutthroats and robbers
      haunted the roads, and river-men, if they had not drunk away their last
      dollar in New Orleans, were worth spoiling. Or, if it offered, they took
      passage on some fast sailing clipper bound for Baltimore or Philadelphia,
      and crossed the mountains to the Ohio and were within a week or two of
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruce Carrington had seen the day of barge and raft reach its zenith, had
      heard the first steam packet's shrieking whistle which sounded the
      death-knell of the ancient order, though the shifting of the trade was a
      slow matter and the glory of the old did not pass over to the new at once,
      but lingered still in mighty fleets of rafts and keel-boats and in the
      Homeric carousals of some ten thousand of the half-horse, half-alligator
      breed that nightly gathered in New Orleans. Broad-horns and mud-sills they
      were called in derision. A strange race of aquatic pioneers, jeans and
      leather clad, the rifle and the setting-pole equally theirs, they came out
      of every stream down which a scow could be thrust at flood-time; from tiny
      settlements far back among the hills; from those bustling sinks of
      iniquity, the river towns. But now, surely, yet almost imperceptibly,
      their commerce was slipping from them. At all the landings they were being
      elbowed by the newcomers&mdash;men who wore brass buttons and gold braid,
      and shiny leather shoes instead of moccasins; men with white hands and
      gold rings on their fingers and diamonds in their shirts&mdash;men whose
      hair and clothing kept the rancid smell of oil and smoke and machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the reading of the warrant that morning, Charley Balaam had shown
      Carrington the road to the Forks, assuring him when they separated that
      with a little care and decent use of his eyes it would be possible to
      fetch up there and not pass plumb through the settlement without knowing
      where he was. But Carrington had found the Forks without difficulty. He
      had seen the old mill his grandfather had built almost a hundred years
      before, and in the churchyard he had found the graves and read the
      inscriptions that recorded the virtues of certain dead and gone
      Carringtons. It had all seemed a very respectable link with the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on his way to Fayetteville, where he intended to spend the night,
      and perhaps a day or two in looking around, when the meeting with Betty
      and Murrell occurred. As Murrell disappeared in the direction of Balaam's,
      Carrington took a spiteful kick at the unoffending coin, and strode off
      down the Fayetteville pike. But the girl's face remained with him. It was
      a face he would like to see again. He wondered who she was, and if she
      lived in the big house on the other road, the house beyond the red gate
      which Charley Balaam had told him was called the Barony.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still thinking of the girl when he ate his supper that night at
      Cleggett's Tavern. Later, in the bar, he engaged his host in idle gossip.
      Mr. Cleggett knew all about the Barony and its owner, Nat Ferris. Ferris
      was a youngish man, just married. Carrington experienced a quick sinking
      of the heart. A fleeting sense of humor succeeded&mdash;had he interfered
      between man and wife? But surely if this had been the case the girl would
      not have spoken as she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wound Mr. Cleggett up with sundry pegs of strong New England rum. He
      had met a gentleman and lady on the road that day; he wondered, as he
      toyed with his glass, if it could have been the Ferrises? Mounted? Yes,
      mounted. Then it was Ferris and his wife&mdash;or it might have been
      Captain Murrell and Miss Malroy the captain was a strapping, black-haired
      chap who rode a big bay horse. Miss Malroy did not live in that part of
      the country; she was a friend of Mrs. Ferris', belonged in Kentucky or
      Tennessee, or somewhere out yonder&mdash;at any rate she was bringing her
      visit to an end, for Ferris had instructed him to reserve a place for her
      in the north-bound stage on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington suddenly remembered that he had some thought of starting north
      in the morning himself, but he was still undecided. How about it if he
      deferred his decision until the stage was leaving? Mr. Cleggett consulted
      his bookings and was of the opinion that his chances would not be good;
      and Carrington hastily paid down his money. Later in the privacy of his
      own room he remarked meditatively, viewing his reflection in the mirror
      that hung above the chimneypiece, &ldquo;I reckon you're plain crazy!&rdquo; and
      seemed to free himself from all further responsibility for his own acts
      whatever they might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage left at six, and as Carrington climbed to his seat the next
      morning Mr. Cleggett was advising the driver to look sharp when he came to
      the Barony road, as he was to pick up a party there. It was Carrington who
      looked sharp, and almost at the spot where he had seen Betty Malroy the
      day before he saw her again, with Ferris and Judith and a pile of luggage
      bestowed by the wayside. Betty did not observe him as the coach stopped,
      for she was intent on her farewells with her friends. There were hasty
      words of advice from Ferris, prolonged good-byes to Judith, tears&mdash;kisses&mdash;while
      a place was being made for her many boxes and trunks. Carrington viewed
      the luggage with awe, and listened without shame. He gathered that she was
      going north to Washington; that her final destination was some point
      either on the Ohio or Mississippi, and that her name was Betty. Then the
      door slammed and the stage was in motion again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington felt sensibly enriched by the meager facts now in his
      possession. He was especially interested in her name. Be liked the sound
      of it. It suited her. He even tried it under his breath softly. Betty&mdash;Betty
      Malroy&mdash;next he fell to wondering if those few hurried words she had
      addressed to him could possibly be construed as forming a basis for a
      further acquaintance. Or wasn't it far more likely she would prefer to
      forget the episode of the previous day, which had clearly been anything
      but agreeable?
    </p>
    <p>
      All through the morning they swung forward in the heat and dust and glare,
      with now and then a brief pause when they changed horses, and at midday
      rattled into the shaded main street of a sleepy village and drew up before
      the tavern where dinner was waiting them&mdash;a fact that was announced
      by a bare-legged colored boy armed with a club, who beat upon a suspended
      wagon tire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty saw Carrington when she took her seat, and gave a scarcely
      perceptible start of surprise. Then her face was flooded with a rich
      color. This was the man who saw her with Captain Murrell yesterday I What
      must he think of her! There was a brief moment of irresolution and then
      she bowed coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just barely managed it. I reckon nobody could misunderstand that. By
      no means cordial&mdash;but of course not!&rdquo; Carrington reflected. His own
      handsome face had been expressionless when he returned her bow, and Betty
      could not have guessed how consoled and comforted he was by it. With great
      fortitude and self-denial he forbore to look in her direction again, but
      he lingered at the table until the last moment that he might watch her
      when she returned to the coach. Mr. Carrington entertained ideals where
      women were concerned, and even though he had been the one to profit by it
      he would not have had Betty depart in the minutest particular from those
      stringent rules he laid down for her sex. Consequently that distant air
      she bore toward him filled him with satisfaction. It was quite enough for
      the present&mdash;for the present&mdash;that three times each day his
      perseverance and determination were rewarded by that curt little
      acknowledgment of her indebtedness to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was four days to Richmond. Four days of hot, dusty travel, four nights
      of uncomfortable cross-road stations, where Betty suffered sleepless
      nights and the unaccustomed pangs of early rising. She occasionally found
      herself wondering who Carrington was. She approved of the manner in which
      he conducted himself. She liked a man who could be unobtrusive. Traveling
      like that day after day it would have been so easy for him to be
      officious. But he never addressed her and refused to see any opportunity
      to assist her in entering or quitting the stage, leaving that to some one
      else. Presently she was sorry she had bowed to him that first day&mdash;so
      self-contained and unpresuming a person as he would evidently have been
      quite satisfied to overlook the omission. Then she began to be haunted by
      doubts. Perhaps, after all, he had not recognized her as the girl he had
      met in the road! This gave her a very queer feeling indeed&mdash;for what
      must he think of her? And the next time she bowed to this perfect stranger
      she threw a chilling austerity into the salutation quite at variance with
      her appearance, for the windy drive had tangled her hair and blown it in
      curling wisps about her face. This served to trouble Carrington
      excessively, and furnished him with food for reflection through all his
      waking moments for the succeeding eight and forty hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he found himself seated opposite her at breakfast. He
      received another curt little nod, cool and distant, as he took his seat,
      but he felt strongly that a mere bowing acquaintance would no longer
      suffice; so he passed her a number of things she didn't want, and
      presently ventured the opinion that she must find traveling as they were,
      day after day, very fatiguing. Surprised at the sound of his voice, before
      she knew what she was doing, Betty said, &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; closed her red
      lips, and was immediately dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington at once relapsed into silence and ventured no further opinion
      on any topic. Betty was left wondering whether she had been rude, and when
      they met again asked if the stage would reach Washington at the advertised
      hour. She had been consulting the copy of Badger's and Porter's Register
      which Ferris had thrust into her satchel the morning she left the Barony,
      and which, among a multiplicity of detail as to hotels and taverns, gave
      the runnings of all the regular stage lines, packets, canal-boats and
      steamers, by which one could travel over the length and breadth of the
      land. &ldquo;You stop in Washington?&rdquo; said Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty shook her head. &ldquo;No, I am going on to Wheeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're fortunate in being so nearly home,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I am going on to
      Memphis.&rdquo; He felt it was time she knew this, or else she might think his
      movements were dictated by her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, I am going to Memphis, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? By canal to Cumberland, and then by stage over the National Road
      to Wheeling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty nodded. &ldquo;It makes one wish they'd finish their railroads, doesn't
      it? Do you suppose they'll ever get as far west as Memphis?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say it's going to be bad for the river trade when they're built on
      something besides paper,&rdquo; answered Carrington. &ldquo;And I happen to be a
      flatboat-man, Miss Malroy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty gave him a glance of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how did you learn my name?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I heard your friends speak it,&rdquo; he answered glibly. But Betty's
      smooth brow was puckered thoughtfully. She wondered if he had&mdash;and if
      he hadn't. It was very odd certainly that he should know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the railroads are going to hurt the steamboats?&rdquo; she presently said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't say that. I was thinking of the flatboats that have already
      been hurt by the steamers,&rdquo; he replied. Now to the western mind the
      river-men typified all that was reckless and wild. It was their carousals
      that gave an evil repute to such towns as Natchez. But this particular
      river-man looked harmless. &ldquo;Carrington is my name, Miss Malroy,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more was said just then, for Betty became reserved and he did not
      attempt to resume the conversation. A day later they rumbled into
      Washington, and as Betty descended from the coach, Carrington stepped to
      her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you'll stop here, Miss Malroy?&rdquo; he said, indicating the tavern
      before which the stage had come to a stand. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Betty briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can be of any service to you&mdash;&rdquo; he began, with just a touch of
      awkwardness in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you, Mr. Carrington,&rdquo; said Betty quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night... good-by,&rdquo; he turned away, and Betty saw his tall form
      disappear in the twilight.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII. THE FIGHT AT SLOSSON'S TAVERN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Murrell had ridden out of the hills some hours back. He now faced the
      flashing splendors of a June sunset, but along the eastern horizon the
      mountains rose against a somber sky. Night was creeping into their
      fastnesses. Already there was twilight in those cool valleys lying within
      the shadow of mighty hills. A month and more had elapsed since Bob Yancy's
      trial. Just two days later man and boy disappeared from Scratch Hill. This
      had served to rouse Murrell to the need of immediate action, but he found,
      where Yancy was concerned, Scratch Hill could keep a secret, while
      Crenshaw's mouth was closed on any word that might throw light on the
      plans of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's plain to my mind, Captain, that Bladen will never get the boy. I
      reckon Bob's gone into hiding with him,&rdquo; said the merchant, with spacious
      candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fugitives had not gone into hiding, however; they had traversed the
      state from east to west, and Murrell was soon on their trail and pressing
      forward in pursuit. Reaching the mountains, he heard of them first as ten
      days ahead of him and bound for west Tennessee, the ten days dwindled to a
      week, the week became five days, the five days three; and now as he
      emerged from the last range of hills he caught sight of them. They were
      half a mile distant perhaps, but he was certain that the man and boy he
      saw pass about a turn in the road were the man and boy he had been
      following for a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not mistaken. The man was Bob Yancy and the boy was Hannibal. Yancy
      had acted with extraordinary decision. He had sold his few acres at
      Scratch Hill for a lump sum to Crenshaw&mdash;it was to the latter's
      credit that the transaction was one in which he could feel no real pride
      as a man of business&mdash;and just a day later Yancy and the boy had
      quitted Scratch Hill in the gray dawn, and turned their faces westward.
      Tennessee had become their objective point, since here was a region to
      which they could fix a name, while the rest of the world was strange to
      them. As they passed the turn in the road where Murrell had caught his
      first sight of them, Yancy glanced back at the blue wall of the mountains
      where it lay along the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Nevvy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we've put a heap of distance between us and old
      Scratch Hill; all I can say is, if there's as much the other side of the
      Hill as there is this side, the world's a monstrous big place fo' to
      ramble about in.&rdquo; He carried his rifle and a heavy pack. Hannibal had a
      much smaller pack and his old sporting rifle, burdens of which his Uncle
      Bob relieved him at brief intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past ten days their journey had been conducted in a leisurely
      fashion. As Yancy said, they were seeing the world, and it was well to
      take a good look at it while they had a chance. He was no longer fearful
      of pursuit and his temperament asserted itself&mdash;the minimum of
      activity sufficed. Usually they camped just where the night overtook them;
      now and then they varied this by lodging at some tavern, for since there
      was money in his pocket, Yancy was disposed to spend it. He could not
      conceive that it had any other possible use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly out of the silence came the regular beat of hoofs. These grew
      nearer and nearer, and at last when they were quite close, Yancy faced
      about. He instantly recognized Murrell and dropped his rifle into the
      crook of his arm. The act was instinctive, since there was no reason to
      believe that the captain had the least interest in the boy. Smilingly
      Murrell reined in his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;Bob Yancy!&rdquo; he cried, in apparent astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;Bob Yancy. Does it happen you are looking fo' him,
      Captain?&rdquo; inquired Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no, Bob. I'm on my way West. Shake hands.&rdquo; His manner was frank
      and winning, and Yancy met it with an equal frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, me and my nevvy are glad to meet some one we've knowed afore.
      The world are a lonesome place once you get shut of yo'r own dooryard,&rdquo; he
      said. Murrell slipped from his saddle and fell into step at Yancy's side
      as they moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were mightily stirred up at the Cross Roads when I left, wondering
      what had come of you,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you quit there?&rdquo; asked Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a fortnight ago,&rdquo; said Murrell. &ldquo;Every one approves of your action
      in this matter, Yancy,&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's kind of them,&rdquo; responded Yancy, a little dryly. There was no
      reason for it, but he was becoming distrustful of Murrell, and uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bladen's hurt himself by the stand he's taken it this matter,&rdquo; Murrell
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went forward in silence, Yancy brooding and suspicious. For the last
      mile or so their way had led through an unbroken forest, but a sudden turn
      in the road brought them to the edge of an extensive clearing. Close to
      the road were several buildings, but not a tree had been spared to shelter
      them and they stood forth starkly, the completing touch to a civilization
      that was still in its youth, unkempt, rather savage, and ruthlessly
      utilitarian. A sign, the work of inexpert hands, announced the somewhat
      dingy structure of hewn logs that stood nearest the roadside a tavern.
      There was a horse rack in front of it and a trampled space. It was flanked
      by its several sheds and barns on one hand and a woodpile on the other.
      Beyond the woodpile a rail fence inclosed a corn-field, and beyond the
      barns and sheds a similar fence defined the bounds of a stumpy
      pasture-lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the door of the tavern the figure of a man emerged. Pausing by the
      horse rack he surveyed the two men and boy, if not with indifference, at
      least with apathy. Just above his head swung the sign with its legend,
      &ldquo;Slosson&mdash;Entertainment&rdquo;; but if he were Slosson, one could take the
      last half of the sign either as a poetic rhapsody on the part of the
      painter, or the yielding to some meaningless convention, for in his
      person, Mr. Slosson suggested none of those qualities of brain or heart
      that trenched upon the lighter amenities of life. He was black-haired and
      bull-necked, and there was about him a certain shagginess which a recent
      toilet performed at the horse trough had not served to mitigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy?&rdquo; he drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy?&rdquo; responded Mr. Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall you stop here?&rdquo; asked Murrell, sinking his voice. Yancy nodded.
      &ldquo;Can you put us up?&rdquo; inquired Murrell, turning to the tavern-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that's what I'm here for,&rdquo; said Slosson. Murrell glanced about
      the empty yard. &ldquo;Slack,&rdquo; observed Slosson languidly. &ldquo;Yes, sir, slack's
      the only name for it.&rdquo; It was understood he referred to the state of
      trade. He looked from one to the other of the two men. As his eyes rested
      on Murrell, that gentleman raised the first three fingers of his right
      hand. The gesture was ever so little, yet it seemed to have a tonic effect
      on Mr. Slosson. What might have developed into a smile had he not
      immediately suppressed it, twisted his bearded lips as he made an
      answering movement. &ldquo;Eph, come here, you!&rdquo; Slosson raised his voice. This
      call brought a half-grown black boy from about a corner of the tavern, to
      whom Murrell relinquished his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's liquor,&rdquo; said the captain over his shoulder, moving off in the
      direction of the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Nevvy!&rdquo; said Yancy following, and they all entered the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here's to the best of good luck!&rdquo; said Murrell, as he raised his
      glass to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; responded Yancy. Murrell pulled out a roll of bills, one of
      which he tossed on the bar. Then after a moment's hesitation he detached a
      second bill from the roll and turned to Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, youngster&mdash;a present for you;&rdquo; he said good-naturedly.
      Hannibal, embarrassed by the unexpected gift, edged to his Uncle Bob's
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you-all got nothing to say to the gentleman?&rdquo; asked Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds a heap better. Let's see&mdash;why, if it ain't ten dollars&mdash;think
      of that!&rdquo; said Yancy, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's have another drink,&rdquo; suggested Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Hannibal stole out into the yard. He still held the bill in his
      hand, for he did not quite know how to dispose of his great wealth. After
      debating this matter for a moment he knotted it carefully in one corner of
      his handkerchief. But this did not quite suit him, for he untied the knot
      and looked at the bill again, turning it over and over in his hand. Then
      he folded it carefully into the smallest possible compass and once more
      tied a corner of his handkerchief about it, this time with two knots
      instead of one; these he afterward tested with his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'low she won't come undone now!&rdquo; he said, with satisfaction. He stowed
      the handkerchief away in his trousers pocket, ramming it very tight with
      his fist. He was much relieved when this was done, for wearing a care-free
      air he sauntered across the yard and established himself on the top rail
      of the corn-field fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colored boy, armed with an ax, appeared at the woodpile and began to
      chop in the desultory fashion of his race, pausing every few seconds to
      stare in the direction of his white compatriot, who met his glance with
      reserve. Whereupon Mr. Slosson's male domestic indulged in certain strange
      antics that were not rightly any part of woodchopping. This yet further
      repelled Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The disgustin' chattel!&rdquo; he muttered under his breath, quoting his Uncle
      Bob, with whom, in theory at least, race feeling was strong. Yancy
      appeared at the door of the bar and called to him, and as the boy slid
      from the fence and ran toward him across the yard, the Scratch Hiller
      sauntered forth to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it's all right, Nevvy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but we don't know nothing
      about this here Captain Murrell&mdash;as he calls himself&mdash;though he
      seems a right clever sort of gentleman; but we won't mention Belle Plain.&rdquo;
       With this caution he led the way into the tavern and back through the bar
      to a low-ceilinged room where Murrell and Slosson were already at table.
      It was intolerably hot, and there lingered in the heavy atmosphere of the
      place stale and unappetizing odors. Only Murrell attempted conversation
      and he was not encouraged; and presently silence fell on the room except
      for the rattle of dishes and the buzzing of flies. When they had finished,
      the stale odors and the heat drove them quickly into the bar again, where
      for a little time Hannibal sat on Yancy's knee, by the door. Presently he
      slipped down and stole out into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The June night was pulsing with life. Above him bats darted in short
      circling flights. In the corn-field and pasture-lot the fireflies lifted
      from their day-long sleep, showing pale points of light in the half
      darkness, while from some distant pond or stagnant watercourse came the
      booming of frogs, presently to swell into a resonant chorus. These were
      the summer night sounds he had known as far back as his memory went.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tavern the three men were drinking&mdash;Murrell with the idea that
      the more Yancy came under the influence of Slosson's corn whisky the
      easier his speculation would be managed. Mr. Yancy on his part believed
      that if Murrell went to bed reasonably drunk he would sleep late and give
      him the opportunity he coveted, to quit the tavern unobserved at break of
      day. Gradually the ice of silence which had held them mute at supper,
      thawed. At first it was the broken lazy speech of men who were disposed to
      quiet, then the talk became brisk&mdash;a steady stream of rather dreary
      gossip of horses and lands and negroes, of speculations past and gone in
      these great staples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal crossed to the corn-field. There, in the friendly gloom, he
      examined his handkerchief and felt of the rolled-up bill. Then he made
      count of certain silver and copper coins which he had in his other pocket.
      Satisfied that he had sustained no loss, he again climbed to the top rail
      of the fence where he seated himself with an elbow resting on one knee and
      his chin in the palm of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got ten dollars and seventy cents&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;and the clostest
      shooting rifle I ever tossed to my shoulder.&rdquo; He seemed but small to have
      accomplished such a feat. He meditated for a little space. &ldquo;I reckon when
      we strike the settlements again I should like to buy my Uncle Bob a
      present.&rdquo; With knitted brows he considered what this should be, canvassing
      Yancy's needs. He had about decided on a ring such as Captain Murrell was
      wearing, when he heard the shuffling of bare feet over the ground and a
      voice spoke out of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When yo' get to feelin' like sleep, young boss, Mas'r Slosson he says I
      show yo' to yo' chamber.&rdquo; It was Slosson's boy Eph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you-all happen to notice what they're doing in the tavern now?&rdquo; asked
      Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I low they're makin' a regular hog-killin' of it,&rdquo; said Eph smartly.
      Hannibal descended from the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can show me my chamber,&rdquo; he said, and his tone was severe. What
      a white man did was not a matter for a black man to criticize. They went
      toward the open door of the tavern. Mr. Slosson's corn whisky had already
      wrought a marked transformation in the case of Slosson himself. His
      usually terse speech was becoming diffuse and irrelevant, while vacant
      laughter issued from his lips. Yancy was apparently unaffected by the good
      cheer of which he had partaken, but Murrell's dark face was flushed. The
      Scratch Hiller's ability to carry his liquor exceeded anything he had
      anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You-all run along to bed, Nevvy,&rdquo; said Yancy, as Hannibal entered the
      room. &ldquo;I'll mighty soon follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eph secured a tin candle-stick with a half-burnt candle in it and led the
      way into the passage back of the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mas'r Slosson's jus' mo' than layin' back!&rdquo; he said, as he closed the
      door after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you-all will lay back, too, when you get growed up,&rdquo; retorted
      Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I won't. White folks won't let a nigger lay back. Onliest time a
      nigger sees co'n whisky's when he's totin' it fo' some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon a nigger's fool enough without corn whisky,&rdquo; said Hannibal. They
      mounted a flight of stairs and passed down a narrow hall. This brought
      them to the back of the building, and Eph pushed open the door on his
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This heah's yo' chamber,&rdquo; he said, and preceding his companion into the
      room, placed the candle on a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I low I clean forgot something!&rdquo; cried Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's yo' bundle and yo' gun, I done fotched 'em up heah and laid 'em
      on yo' bed,&rdquo; said Eph, preparing' to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly am obliged to you,&rdquo; said Hannibal, and with a good night, Eph
      retired, closing the door after him, and the boy heard the patter of his
      bare feet as he scuttled down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was rising and Hannibal went to the open window and glanced out.
      His room overlooked the back yard of the inn and a neglected truck patch.
      Starting from a point beyond the truck patch and leading straight away to
      the woodland beyond was a fenced lane, with the corn-field and the
      pasture-lot on either hand. Immediately below his window was the steeply
      slanting roof of a shed. For a moment he considered the night, not
      unaffected by its beauty, then, turning from the window, he moved his
      bundle and rifle to the foot of the bed, where they would be out of his
      way, kicked off his trousers, blew out the candle and lay down. The gossip
      of the men in the bar ran like a whisper through the house, and with it
      came frequent bursts of noisy laughter. Listening for these sounds the boy
      dozed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yancy had become more and more convinced as the evening passed that
      Murrell was bent on getting him drunk, and suspicion mounted darkly to his
      brain. He felt certain that he was Bladen's agent. Now, Mr. Yancy took an
      innocent pride in his ability to &ldquo;cool off liquor.&rdquo; Perhaps it was some
      heritage from a well living ancestry that had hardened its head with Port
      and Madeira in the days when the Yancys owned their acres and their
      slaves. Be that as it may, he was equal to the task he had set himself. He
      saw with satisfaction the flush mount to Murrell's swarthy cheeks, and
      felt that the limit of his capacity was being reached. Mr. Slosson had
      become a sort of Greek chorus. He anticipated all the possible phases of
      drunkenness that awaited his companions. He went from silence to noisy
      mirth, when his unmeaning laughter rang through the house; he told long
      witless stories as he leaned against the bar; he became melancholy and
      described the loss of his wife five years before. From melancholy he
      passed to sullenness and seemed ready to fasten a quarrel on Yancy, but
      the latter deftly evaded any such issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you-all want is another drink,&rdquo; he said affably. &ldquo;With all you been
      through you need a tonic, so shove along that extract of cornshucks and
      molasses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a rip-staver,&rdquo; said Slosson thickly. &ldquo;But I've knowed enough sorrow
      to kill a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have that look. Captain, will you join us?&rdquo; asked Yancy. Murrell
      shook his head, but he made a significant gesture to Slosson as Yancy
      drained his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a drink with me!&rdquo; cried Slosson, giving way to drunken laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you reckon you'll spite yo' appetite fo' breakfast, neighbor?&rdquo;
       suggested Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean you won't drink with me?&rdquo; roared Slosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain's dropped out and I 'low it's about time fo' these here
      festivities to come to an end. I'm thinking some of going to bed myself,&rdquo;
       said Yancy. He kept his eyes fixed on Murrell. He realized that if the
      latter could prevent it he was not to leave the bar. Murrell stood between
      him and the door; more than this, he stood between him and his rifle,
      which leaned against the wall in the far corner of the room. Slosson
      roared out a protest to his words. &ldquo;That's all right, neighbor,&rdquo; retorted
      Yancy over his shoulder, &ldquo;but I'm going to bed.&rdquo; He never shifted his
      glance from Murrell's face. Scowling now, the captain's eyes blazed back
      their challenge as he thrust his right hand under his coat. &ldquo;Fair play&mdash;I
      don't know who you are, but I know what you want!&rdquo; said Yancy, the light
      in his frank gray eyes deepening. Murrell laughed and took a forward step.
      At the same moment Slosson snatched up a heavy club from back of the bar
      and dealt Yancy a murderous blow. A single startled cry escaped the
      Scratch Hitler; he struck out wildly as he lurched toward Murrell, who
      drew his knife and drove it into his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Groping wildly, Yancy reached his rifle and faced about. His scalp lay
      open where Slosson's treacherous blow had fallen and his face was covered
      with blood; even as his fingers stiffened they found the hammer, but
      Murrell, springing forward, kicked the gun out of his hands. Dashing the
      blood from his eyes, Yancy threw himself on Murrell. Then, as they
      staggered to and fro, Yancy dully bent on strangling his enemy, Slosson&mdash;whom
      the sight of blood had wonderfully sobered&mdash;rushed out from the bar
      and let loose a perfect torrent of blows with his club. Murrell felt the
      fingers that gripped him grow weak, and Yancy dropped heavily to the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long the boy slept he never knew, but he awoke with a start and a
      confused sense of things. He seemed to have heard a cry for help. But the
      tavern was very silent now. The distant murmur of voices and the shouts of
      laughter had ceased. He lifted himself up on his elbow and glanced from
      the window. The heavens were pale and gray. It was evidently very late,
      probably long after midnight but where was his Uncle Bob?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank back on his pillow intent and listening. What he had heard, what
      he still expected to hear, he could not have told, but he was sure he had
      been roused by a cry of some sort. A chilling terror that gripped him fast
      and would not let him go, mounted to his brain. Once he thought he heard
      cautious steps beyond his door. He could not be certain, yet he imagined
      the bull-necked landlord standing with his ear to some crack seeking to
      determine whether or not he slept. His thin little body grew rigid and a
      cold sweat started from him. He momentarily expected the latch to be
      lifted, then in the heavy silence he caught the sound of some stealthy
      movement beyond the lath and plaster partition, and an instant later an
      audible footfall. He heard the boards creak and give, as the person who
      had been standing before his door passed down the hall, down the stairs,
      and to the floor below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Limp and shivering, he drew his scanty covering tight about him. In the
      silence that succeeded, he once more became aware of the tireless chorus
      of the frogs, the hooting of the owls, and the melancholy and oft-repeated
      call of the whippoorwill. But where was his Uncle Bob? Why didn't he come
      to bed? And whose was that cry for help he had heard? Memories of idle
      tales of men foully dealt with in these lonely taverns, of murderous
      landlords, and mysterious guests who were in league with them, flashed
      through his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murrell had followed them for this&mdash;and had killed his Uncle Bob, and
      he would be sent back to Bladen! The law had said that Bladen could have
      him and that his Uncle Bob must give him up. The law put men in prison&mdash;it
      hanged them sometimes&mdash;his Uncle Bob had told him all about it&mdash;by
      the neck with ropes until they were dead! Maybe they wouldn't send him
      back; maybe they would do with him what they had already done with his
      Uncle Bob; he wanted the open air, the earth under his feet, and the sky
      over his head. The four walls stifled him. He was not afraid of the night,
      he could run and hide in it&mdash;there were the woods and fields where he
      would be safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slid from the bed, and for a long moment stood cold and shaking, his
      every sense on the alert. With infinite caution he got into his trousers
      and again paused to listen, since he feared his least movement might
      betray him. Reassured, he picked up his battered hat from the floor and
      inch by inch crept across the squeaking boards to the window. When the
      window was reached he paused once more to listen, but the quiet that was
      everywhere throughout the house gave him confidence. He straddled the low
      sill, and putting out his hand gripped the stock of his rifle and drew
      that ancient weapon toward him. Next he secured his pack, and was ready
      for flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encumbered by his belongings, but with no mind to sacrifice them, he
      stepped out upon the shed and made his way down the slant of the roof to
      the eaves. He tossed his bundle to the ground and going down on his knees
      lowered his rifle, letting the muzzle fall lightly against the side of the
      shed as it left his hand, then he lay flat on his stomach and, feet first,
      wriggled out into space. When he could no longer preserve his balance, he
      gave himself a shove away from the eaves and dropped clear of the
      building.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he recovered himself he was sure he heard a door open and close, and
      threw himself prone on the ground, where the black shadow cast by the
      tavern hid him. At the same moment two dark figures came from about a
      corner of the building. He could just distinguish that they carried some
      heavy burden between them and that they staggered as they moved. He heard
      Slosson curse drunkenly, and a whispered word from Murrell. The two men
      slowly crossed the truck patch, and the boy's glance followed them, his
      eyes starting from his head. Just at the mouth of the lane they paused and
      put down their burden; a few words spoken in a whisper passed between them
      and they began to drag some dark thing down the lane, their backs bent,
      their heads bowed and the thing they dragged bumping over the uneven
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed out of sight, and breathless and palsied, Hannibal crept about
      a corner of the tavern. He must be sure! The door of the bar stood open;
      the lamps were still burning, and the upturned chairs and a broken table
      told of the struggle that had taken place there. The boy rested his hand
      on the top step as he stared fearfully into the room. His palm came away
      with a great crimson splotch. But he was not satisfied yet. He must be
      sure&mdash;sure! He passed around the building as the men had done and
      crossed the truck patch to the mouth of the lane. Here he slid through the
      fence into the corn-field, and, well sheltered, worked his way down the
      rows. Presently he heard a distant sound&mdash;a splash&mdash;surely it
      was a splash&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later the men came up the lane, to disappear in the direction of
      the tavern. Hannibal peered after them. His very terrors, while they
      wrenched and tortured him, gave him a desperate kind of courage. As the
      gloom hid the two men, he started forward again; he must know the meaning
      of that sound&mdash;that splash, if it was a splash. He reached the end of
      the cornfield, climbed the fence, and entered a deadening of slashed and
      mutilated timber. In the long wet grass he found where the men had dragged
      their burden. He reached down and swept his hand to and fro&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;the
      third time his little palm came away red and discolored.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the first pale premonition of dawn in the sky, and as he hurried
      on the light grew, and the black trunks of trees detached themselves from
      the white mist that filled the woods and which the dawn made visible.
      There was light enough for him to see that he was following the trail left
      by the men; he could distinguish where the dew had been brushed from the
      long grass. Advancing still farther, he heard the clear splash of running
      water, an audible ripple that mounted into a silver cadence. Day was
      breaking now. The lifeless gray along the eastern horizon had changed to
      orange. Still following the trail, he emerged upon the bank of the Elk
      River, white like the woods with its ghostly night sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull beat of the child's heart quickened as he gazed out on the swift
      current that was hurrying on with its dreadful secret. Then the full
      comprehension of his loss seemed to overwhelm him and he was utterly
      desolate. Sobs shook him, and he dropped on his knees, holding fast to the
      stock of his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob&mdash;Uncle Bob, come back! Can't you come back!&rdquo; he wailed
      miserably. Presently he staggered to his feet. Convulsive sobs still
      wrenched his little body. What was he to do? Those men&mdash;his Uncle
      Bob's murderers&mdash;would go to his room; they would find his empty bed
      and their search for him would begin! Not for anything would he have gone
      back through the corn-field or the lane to the road. He had the courage to
      go forward, but not to retrace his steps; and the river, deep and swift,
      barred his path. As he glanced about, he saw almost at his feet a dug-out,
      made from a single poplar log. It was secured to an overhanging branch by
      a length of wild grape-vine. With one last fearful look off across the
      deadening in the direction of the tavern, he crept down to the water's
      edge and entered the canoe. In a moment, he had it free from its lashing
      and the rude craft was bumping along the bank in spite of his best efforts
      with the paddle. Then a favoring current caught it and swept it out toward
      the center of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was much too big and clumsy for him to control without the stream's
      help, though he labored doggedly with his paddle. Now he was broadside to
      the current, now he was being spun round and round, but always he was
      carried farther and farther from the spot where he had embarked. He passed
      about a bend; and a hundred yards beyond, about a second bend; then the
      stream opened up straight before him a half-mile of smooth running water.
      Far down it, at the point where the trees met in the unbroken line of the
      forest and the water seemed to vanish mysteriously, he could distinguish a
      black moving object; some ark or raft, doubtless.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the smoother water of the long reach, Hannibal began to make head
      against the flood. The farther shore became the nearer, and finally he
      drove the bow of his canoe up on a bit of shelving bank, and seizing his
      pack and rifle, sprang ashore. Panting and exhausted, he paused just long
      enough to push the canoe out into the stream again, and then, with his
      rifle and pack in his hands, turned his small tear-stained face toward the
      wooded slope beyond. As he toiled up it in the wide silence of the dawn, a
      mournful wind burst out of the north, filling the air about him with
      withered leaves and the dead branches of trees.

      CHAPTER VIII. ON THE RIVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Betty stood under a dripping umbrella in the midst of a drenching
      downpour, her boxes and trunks forming a neat pyramid of respectable size
      beside her. She was somewhat perturbed in spirit, since they contained
      much elaborate finery all in the very latest eastern fashion, spoils that
      were the fruit of a heated correspondence with Tom, who hadn't seemed at
      all alive to the fact that Betty was nearly eighteen and in her own right
      a young woman of property. A tarpaulin had been thrown over the heap, and
      with one eye on it and the other on the stretch of yellow canal up which
      they were bringing the fast packet Pioneer, she was waiting impatiently to
      see her belongings transferred to a place of safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just arrived by the four-horse coach that plyed regularly between
      Washington and Georgetown, she had found the long board platform beside
      the canal crowded with her fellow passengers, their number augmented by
      those who delight to share vicariously in travel and to whom the departure
      of a stage or boat was a matter of urgent interest requiring their
      presence, rain or shine. Suddenly she became aware of a tall, familiar
      figure moving through the crowd. It was Bruce Carrington. At the same
      moment he saw her, and with a casual air that quite deceived her,
      approached; and Betty, who had been feeling very lonely and very homesick,
      was somehow instantly comforted at sight of him. She welcomed him almost
      as a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're leaving to-night?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;isn't it miserable the way it rains? And why are they so slow&mdash;why
      don't they hurry with that boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's in the last lock now,&rdquo; explained Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My clothes will all be ruined,&rdquo; said Betty. He regarded the dress she
      wore with instant concern. &ldquo;No&mdash;I mean the things in my trunks; this
      doesn't matter,&rdquo; and Betty nodded toward the pile under the steaming
      tarpaulin. Carrington's dark eyes opened with an expression of mild
      wonder. And so those trunks were full of clothes&mdash;Oh, Lord!&mdash;he
      looked down at the flushed, impatient face beside him with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see that they are taken care of,&rdquo; he said, for the boat was
      alongside the platform now; and gathering up Betty's hand luggage, he
      helped her aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they had reached Wheeling, Betty had quite parted with
      whatever superficial prejudice she might have had concerning river-men.
      This particular one was evidently a very nice river-man, an exception to
      his kind. She permitted him to assume the burden of her plans, and no
      longer scanned the pages of her Badger's and Porter's with a puckered
      brow. It reposed at the bottom of her satchel. He made choice of the
      steamer on which she should continue her journey, and thoughtfully chose
      The Naiad&mdash;a slow boat, with no reputation for speed to sustain. It
      meant two or three days longer on the river, but what of that? There would
      be no temptation in the engine-room to attach a casual wrench or so to the
      safety-valve as an offset to the builder's lack of confidence in his own
      boilers. He saw to it that her state-room was well aft&mdash;steamers had
      a trick of blowing up forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ne had now reached a state of the utmost satisfaction with himself and the
      situation. Betty was friendly and charming. He walked with her, and he
      talked with her by the hour; and always he was being entangled deeper and
      deeper in the web of her attraction. &ldquo;When alone he would pace the deck
      recalling every word she had spoken. There was that little air of high
      breeding which was Betty's that fascinated him. He had known something of
      the other sort, those who had arrived at prosperity with manners and
      speech that still reflected the meaner condition from which they had
      risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't a thing to offer her&mdash;this is plain madness of mine!&rdquo; he
      kept telling himself, and then the expression of his face would become
      grim and determined. No more of the river for him&mdash;he'd get hold of
      some land and go to raising cotton; that was the way money was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slow as The Naiad was, the days passed much too swiftly for him. When
      Memphis was reached their friendly intercourse would come to an end. There
      would be her brother, of whom she had occasionally spoken&mdash;he would
      be pretty certain to have the ideas of his class.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Betty, she liked this tall fellow who helped her through the
      fatigue of those long days, when there was only the unbroken sweep of the
      forest on either hand, with here and there a clearing where some
      outrageous soul was making a home for himself. The shores became duller,
      wilder, more uninteresting as they advanced, and then at last they entered
      the Mississippi, and she was almost home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was not unexcited by the prospect. She would be the mistress of the
      most splendid place in West Tennessee. She secretly aspired to be a
      brilliant hostess. She could remember when the doors of Belle Plain were
      open to whoever had the least claim to distinction&mdash;statesmen and
      speculators in land; men who were promoting those great schemes of
      improvement, canals and railroads; hard-featured heroes of the two wars
      with England&mdash;a diminishing group; the men of the modern army, the
      pathfinders, and Indian fighters, and sometimes a titled foreigner. She
      wondered if Tom had maintained the traditions of the place. She found that
      Carrington had heard of Belle Plain. He spoke of it with respect, but with
      a noticeable lack of enthusiasm, for how could he feel enthusiasm when he
      must begin his chase after fortune with bare hands?&mdash;he suffered
      acutely whenever it was mentioned. The days, like any other days,
      dwindled. The end of it all was close at hand. Another twenty-four hours
      and Carrington reflected there would only be good-by to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will reach New Madrid to-night,&rdquo; he told her. They were watching the
      river, under a flood of yellow moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then just another day&mdash;Oh, I can hardly wait!&rdquo; cried Betty
      delightedly. &ldquo;Soon I shall hope to see you at Belle Plain, Mr.
      Carrington,&rdquo; she added graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, your&mdash;your family&mdash;&rdquo; he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only just Tom&mdash;he's my half-brother. My mother was left a
      widow when I was a baby. Later, some years after, she married Tom's
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;then he's not even your half-brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's no relation at all&mdash;and much older. When Tom's father died my
      mother made Tom, manager, and still later he was appointed my guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you own Belle Plain?&rdquo; and Carrington sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You have never seen it?&mdash;it's right on the river, you know?&rdquo;
       then Betty's face grew sober: &ldquo;Tom's dreadfully queer&mdash;I expect he'll
      require a lot of managing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you'll be equal to that!&rdquo; said-Carrington, convinced of Betty's
      all-compelling charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not at all certain about Tom&mdash;I can see where we shall have
      serious differences; but then, I shan't have to struggle single-handed
      with him long; a cousin of my mother's is coming to Belle Plain to make
      her home with me&mdash;she'll make' him behave,&rdquo; and Betty laughed
      maliciously. &ldquo;It's a great nuisance being a girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Betty fell to watching for the lights at New Madrid, her elbows
      resting on the rail against which she was leaning, and the soft curve of
      her chin sunk in the palms of her hands. She wondered absently what Judith
      would have said of this river-man. She smiled a little dubiously. Judith
      had certainly vindicated the sincerity of her convictions regarding the
      importance of family, inasmuch as in marrying Ferris she had married her
      own second cousin. She nestled her chin a little closer in her palms. She
      remembered that they had differed seriously over Mr. Yancy's defiance, of
      the law as it was supposed to be lodged in the sacred person of Mr.
      Bladen's agent, the unfortunate Blount. Carrington, with his back against
      a stanchion, watched her discontentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be mighty glad to have this over with, Miss Malroy&mdash;&rdquo; he said
      at length, with a comprehensive sweep toward the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;shan't you?&rdquo; and she opened her eyes questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carrington with a short laugh, drawing a chair near hers and
      sitting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, in surprise, gave him a quick look, and then as quickly glanced
      away from what she encountered in his eyes. Men were accustomed to talk
      sentiment to her, but she had hoped&mdash;well, she really had thought
      that he was, superior to this weakness. She had enjoyed the feeling that
      here was some one, big and strong and thoroughly masculine, with whom she
      could be friendly without&mdash;she took another look at him from under
      the fringe of her long lashes. He was so nice and considerate&mdash;and
      good looking&mdash;he was undeniably this last. It would be a pity! And
      she had already determined that Tom should invite him to Belle Plain. She
      didn't mind if he was a river-man&mdash;they could be friends, for clearly
      he was such an exception. Tom should be cordial to him. Betty stared
      before her, intently watching the river. As she looked, suddenly pale
      points of light appeared on a distant headland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that New Madrid?&mdash;Oh, is it, Mr. Carrington?&rdquo;' she cried eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; but he did not alter his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're not looking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am&mdash;I'm looking at you. I reckon you'll think me crazy, Miss
      Malroy-presumptuous and all that but I wish Memphis could be wiped off the
      map and that we could go on like this for ever!&mdash;no, not like this
      but together&mdash;you and I,&rdquo; he took a deep breath. Betty drew a little
      farther away, and looked at him reproachfully; and then she turned to the
      dancing lights far down the river. Finally she said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were&mdash;different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not,&rdquo; and Carrington's hand covered hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;you mustn't kiss my hand like that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear&mdash;I'm just a man&mdash;and you didn't expect, did you, that I
      could see you this way day after day and not come to love you?&rdquo; He rested
      his arm across the back of her chair and leaned toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo; and Betty moved still farther away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a chance to win your love, Betty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't talk so&mdash;I am nothing to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are. You're everything to me,&rdquo; said Carrington doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not&mdash;I won't be!&rdquo; and Betty stamped her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't help it. I love you and that's all there is about it. I know
      I'm a fool to tell you now, Betty, but years wouldn't make any difference
      in my feeling; and I can't have you go, and perhaps never see you again,
      if I can help it. Betty&mdash;give me a chance&mdash;you don't hate me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do&mdash;yes, I do&mdash;indeed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you don't. Let me see you again and do what I can to make you care
      for me!&rdquo; he implored. But he had a very indignant little aristocrat to
      deal with. She was angry with him, and angry with herself that in spite of
      herself his words moved her. She wouldn't have it so! Why, he wasn't even
      of her class&mdash;her kind! &ldquo;Betty, you don't mean&mdash;&rdquo; he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean&mdash;I am extremely annoyed. I mean just what I say.&rdquo; Betty
      regarded him with wrathful blue eyes. It proved too much for Carrington.
      His arm, dropped about her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall love me&mdash;&rdquo; She was powerless in his embrace. She felt his
      breath on her cheek, then he kissed her. Breathless and crimson, she
      struggled and pushed him from her. Suddenly his arms fell at his side; his
      face was white. &ldquo;I was a brute to do that!&mdash;Betty, forgive me! I am
      sorry&mdash;no, I can't be sorry!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you dare! I hope I may never see you again&mdash;I hate you&mdash;&rdquo;
       said Betty furiously, tears in her eyes and her pulses still throbbing
      from his fierce caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that?&rdquo; he asked slowly, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;a million times, yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe you&mdash;I can't&mdash;I won't!&rdquo; They were alongside the
      New Madrid wharf now, and a certain young man who had been impatiently
      watching The Naiad's lights ever since they became visible crossed the
      gang-plank with a bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty&mdash;why in the name of goodness did you ever, choose this tub?&mdash;everything
      on the river has passed it!&rdquo; said the newcomer. Betty started up with a
      little cry of surprise and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington stepped back. This must be the brother who had come up the
      river from Memphis to meet her&mdash;but her brother's name was Tom! He
      looked this stranger&mdash;this Charley&mdash;over with a hostile eye,
      offended by his good looks, his confident manner, in which he thought he
      detected an air of ownership, as if&mdash;certainly he was holding her
      hands longer than was necessary! Of course, other men were in love with
      her, such a radiant personality held its potent attraction for men, but
      for all that, she was going to belong to him&mdash;Carrington! She did
      like him; she had shown it in a hundred little ways during the last week,
      and he would give her up to no man&mdash;give her up?&mdash;there wasn't
      the least tie between them&mdash;except that kiss&mdash;and she was
      furious because of it. There was nothing for him to do but efface himself.
      He would go now, before the boat started&mdash;and an instant later, when
      Betty, remembering, turned to speak to him, his place by the rail was
      deserted.

      CHAPTER IX. JUDGE SLOCUM PRICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On that day Hannibal was haunted by the memory of what he had heard and
      seen at Slosson's tavern. More than this, there was his terrible sense of
      loss, and the grief he could not master, when his thin, little body was
      shaken by sobs. Marking the course of the road westward, he clung to the
      woods, where his movements were as stealthy as the very shadows
      themselves. He shunned the scattered farms and the infrequent settlements,
      for the fear was strong with him that he might be followed either by
      Murrell or Slosson. But as the dusk of evening crept across the land, the
      great woods, now peopled by strange shadows, sent him forth into the
      highroad. He was beginning to be very tired, and hunger smote him with
      fierce pangs, but back of it all was his sense of bitter loss, his
      desolation, and his loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't forget Uncle Bob if I tried&mdash;&rdquo; he told himself, with
      quivering lips, as he limped wearily along the dusty road, and the tears
      welled up and streaked his pinched face. Now before him he saw the
      scattered lights of a settlement. All his terrors, the terrors that
      grouped themselves about the idea of pursuit and capture, rushed back upon
      him, and in a panic he plunged into the black woods again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the distant lights intensified his loneliness. He had lived a whole
      day without food, a whole day without speech. He began to skirt the
      settlement, keeping well within the thick gloom of the woods, and
      presently, as he stumbled forward, he came to a small clearing in the
      center of which stood a log dwelling. The place seemed deserted. There was
      no sign of life, no light shone from the window, no smoke issued from the
      stick-and-mud chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilted back in a chair by the door of this house a man was sleeping. The
      hoot of an owl from a near-by oak roused him. He yawned and stretched
      himself, thrusting out his fat legs and extending his great arms. Then
      becoming aware of the small figure which had stolen up the path as he
      slept and now stood before him in the uncertain light, he fell to rubbing
      his eyes with the knuckles of his plump hands. The pale night mist out of
      the silent depths of the forest had assumed shapes as strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded, and his voice rumbled thickly forth from his
      capacious chest. The very sound was sleek and unctuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Hannibal,&rdquo; said the small figure. He was meditating flight; he
      glanced over his shoulder toward the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you ain't. He's been dead a thousand years, more or less. Try again,&rdquo;
       recommended the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Hannibal Wayne Hazard,&rdquo; said the boy. The man quitted his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I am glad to know you, Hannibal Wayne Hazard. I am Slocum
      Price&mdash;Judge Slocum Price, sometime major-general of militia and
      ex-member of congress, to mention a few of those honors my fellow
      countrymen have thrust upon me.&rdquo; He made a sweeping gesture with his two
      hands outspread and bowed ponderously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy saw a man of sixty, whose gross and battered visage told its own
      story. There was a sparse white frost about his ears; and his eyes, pale
      blue and prominent, looked out from under beetling brows. He wore a shabby
      plum-colored coat and tight, drab breeches. About his fat neck was a black
      stock, with just a suggestion of soiled linen showing above it. His figure
      was corpulent and unwieldy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man saw a boy of perhaps ten, barefoot, and clothed in homespun shirt
      and trousers. On his head was a ruinous hat much too large for him, but
      which in some mysterious manner he contrived to keep from quite engulfing
      his small features, which were swollen and tear-stained. In his right hand
      he carried a bundle, while his left clutched the brown barrel of a long
      rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't belong in these parts, do you?&rdquo; asked the judge, when he had
      completed his scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered the boy. He glanced off down the road, where lights
      were visible among the trees. &ldquo;What town is that?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasantville&mdash;which is a lie&mdash;but I am neither sufficiently
      drunk nor sufficiently sober to cope with the possibilities your question
      offers. It is a task one should approach only after extraordinary
      preparation,&rdquo; and the sometime major-general of militia grinned
      benevolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a town, ain't it?&rdquo; asked Hannibal doubtfully. He scarcely understood
      this large, smiling gentleman who was so civilly given to speech with him,
      yet strangely enough he was not afraid of him, and his whole soul craved
      human companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's got a name&mdash;but you'll excuse me, I'd much prefer not to tell
      you how I regard it&mdash;you're too young to hear. But stop a bit&mdash;have
      you so much as fifty cents about you?&rdquo; and the judge's eyes narrowed to a
      slit above their folds of puffy flesh. Hannibal, keeping his glance fixed
      on the man's face, fell back a step. &ldquo;I can't let you go if you are
      penniless&mdash;I can't do that!&rdquo; cried the judge, with sudden vehemence.
      &ldquo;You shall be my guest for the night. They're a pack of thieves at the
      tavern,&rdquo; he lowered his voice. &ldquo;I know 'em, for they've plucked me!&rdquo; To
      make sure of his prey, he rested a fat hand on the boy's shoulder and drew
      him gently but firmly into the shanty. As they crossed the threshold he
      kicked the door shut, then with flint and steel he made a light, and
      presently a candle was sputtering in his hands. He fitted it into the neck
      of a tall bottle, and as the light flared up the boy glanced about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interior was mean enough, with its rough walls, dirt floor and black,
      cavernous fireplace. A rude clapboard table did duty as a desk, a fact
      made plain by a horn ink-well, a notary's seal, and a rack with a
      half-dozen quill pens. Above the desk was a shelf of books in worn calf
      bindings, and before it a rickety chair. A shakedown bed in one corner of
      the room was tastefully screened from the public gaze by a tattered quilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boy, don't be afraid. Look on me as a friend,&rdquo; urged the judge, who
      towered above him in the dim candle-light. &ldquo;Here's comfort without
      ostentation. Don't tell me you prefer the tavern, with its corrupt
      associations!&rdquo; Hannibal was silent, and the judge, after a brief moment of
      irresolution, threw open the door. Then he bent toward the small stranger,
      bringing his face close to the child's, while his thick lips wreathed
      themselves in a smile ingratiatingly genial. &ldquo;You can't look me squarely
      in the eye and say you prefer the tavern to these scholarly surroundings?&rdquo;
       he said banteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I'll be glad to stop,&rdquo; answered Hannibal. The judge clapped him
      playfully on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such confidence is inspiring! Make yourself perfectly at home. Are you
      hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I ain't had much to eat to-day,&rdquo; replied Hannibal cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can offer you food then. What do you say to cold fish?&rdquo; the judge
      smacked his lips to impart a relish to the idea. &ldquo;I dare swear I can find
      you some corn bread into the bargain. Tea I haven't got. On the advice of
      my physician, I don't use it. What do you say&mdash;shall we light a fire
      and warm the fish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'low I could eat it cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trouble in the world to start a fire. All we got to do is to go out,
      and pull a few palings off the fence,&rdquo; urged the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do all right just like it is,&rdquo; said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, then!&rdquo; cried the judge gaily, and he began to assemble the
      dainties he had enumerated. &ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; he cleared his throat
      impressively, while benignity shone from every feature of his face. &ldquo;A
      moment since you allowed me to think that you were solvent to the extent
      of fifty cents&mdash;&rdquo; Hannibal looked puzzled. The judge dealt him a
      friendly blow on the back, then stood off and regarded him with a glance
      of great jocularity, his plump knuckles on his hips and his arms akimbo.
      &ldquo;I wonder&rdquo;&mdash;and his eyes assumed a speculative squint &ldquo;I wonder if
      you could be induced to make a temporary loan of that fifty cents? The sum
      involved is really such a ridiculous trifle I don't need to point out to
      you the absolute moral certainty of my returning it at an early date&mdash;say
      to-morrow morning; say to-morrow afternoon at the latest; say even the day
      after at the very outside. Meantime, you shall be my guest. The landlady's
      son has found my notarial seal an admirable plaything&mdash;she has had to
      lick the little devil twice for hooking it&mdash;my pens and stationery
      are at your disposal, should you desire to communicate to absent friends;
      you can have the run of my library!&rdquo; the judge fairly trembled in his
      eagerness. It was not the loss of his money that Hannibal most feared, and
      the coin passed from his possession into his host's custody. As it dropped
      into the latter's great palm he was visibly moved. His moist, blue eyes
      became yet more watery, while his battered old face assumed an expression
      indicating deep inward satisfaction. &ldquo;Thank you, my boy! This is one of
      those intrinsically trifling benefits which, conferred at the moment of
      acute need, touch the heart and tap the unfailing springs of human
      gratitude&mdash;I must step down to the tavern&mdash;when I return, please
      God, we shall know more of each other.&rdquo; While he was still speaking he had
      produced a jug from behind the quilt that screened his bed, and now,
      bareheaded, and with every indication of haste, took himself off into the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Hannibal gravely seated himself at the table. What the judge's
      larder lacked in variety it more than made up for in quantity, and the boy
      was grateful for this fact. He was half famished, and the coarse, abundant
      food was of the sort to which he was accustomed. Presently he heard the
      judge's heavy, shuffling step as he came up the path from the road, and a
      moment later his gross bulk of body filled the doorway. Breathing hard and
      perspiring, the judge entered the shanty, but his eagerness, together with
      his shortness of breath, kept him silent until he had established himself
      in his chair beside the table, with the jug and a cracked glass at his
      elbow. Then, bland and smiling, he turned toward his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you join me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Please, I'd rather not,&rdquo; said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you don't like good liquor?&rdquo; demanded the judge. &ldquo;Not
      even with sugar and a dash of water?&mdash;say, now, don't you like it
      that way, my boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't learned to like it no ways,&rdquo; said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You amaze me&mdash;well&mdash;well&mdash;the greater the joy to which you
      may reasonably aspire. The splendid possibilities of youth are yours. My
      tenderest regards, Hannibal!&rdquo; and he nodded over the rim of the cracked
      glass his shaking hand had carried to his lips. Twice the glass was filled
      and emptied, and then again, his roving, watery eyes rested meditatively
      on the child, who sat very erect in his chair, with his brown hands
      crossed in his lap. &ldquo;Personally, I can drink or not,&rdquo; explained the judge.
      &ldquo;But I hope I am too much a man of the world to indulge in any intemperate
      display of principle.&rdquo; He proved the first clause of his proposition by
      again filling and emptying his glass. &ldquo;Have you a father?&rdquo; he asked
      suddenly. Hannibal shook his head. &ldquo;A mother?&rdquo; demanded the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They both of them done died years and years ago,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;I
      can't tell you how long back it was, but I reckon I don't know much about
      it. I must have been a small child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho&mdash;a small child!&rdquo; cried the judge, laughing. He cocked his head on
      one side and surveyed Hannibal Wayne Hazard with a glance of comic
      seriousness. &ldquo;A small child and in God's name what do you call yourself
      now? To hear you talk one would think you had dabbled your feet in the
      Flood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm most ten,&rdquo; said Hannibal, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can well believe it,&rdquo; responded the judge. &ldquo;And with this weight of
      years, where did you come from and how did you get here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From across the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Mr. Yancy fetched me&mdash;part way.&rdquo; The boy's voice broke when
      he spoke his Uncle Bob's name, and his eyes swam with tears, but the judge
      did not notice this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To West Tennessee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any friends there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've money enough to see you through?&rdquo; and what the judge intended for
      a smile of fatherly affection became a leer of infinite cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got ten dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten dollars&mdash;&rdquo; the judge smacked his lips once. &ldquo;Ten dollars&rdquo; he
      repeated, and smacked his lips twice. There was a brief silence, in which
      he seemed to give way to pleasant reveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      From beyond the open door of the shanty came a multitude of night sounds.
      The moon had risen, and what had been a dusty country road was now a
      streak of silver in the hot light. The purple flush on the judge's face,
      where the dignity that belonged to age had gone down in wreck, deepened.
      The sparse, white frost above his ears was damp with sweat. He removed his
      stock, opened his shirt at the neck, and cast aside his coat; then he
      lighted a blackened pipe, filled his glass, and sank back in his chair.
      The long hours of darkness were all before him, and his senses clothed
      themselves in rich content. Once more his glance rested on the boy. Here,
      indeed, was a guest of whom one might make much and not err&mdash;he felt
      all the benevolence of his nature flow toward him. Ten dollars!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly the tavern would have been no place for you! Well, thank God,
      it wasn't necessary for you to go there. You are more than welcome here. I
      tell you, when you know this place as I know it, you'll regard every
      living soul here with suspicion. Keep 'em at arm's length!&rdquo; he sank his
      voice to an impressive whisper. &ldquo;In particular, I warn you against a
      certain Solomon Mahaffy. You'll see much of him; I haven't known how to
      rebuff the fellow without being rude&mdash;he sticks to me like my shadow.
      He's profited by my charity and he admires my conversation and affects my
      society, but don't tell him you have so much as a rusty copper, for he
      will neither rest nor eat nor sleep until he's plucked you&mdash;tell him
      nothing&mdash;leave him to me. I keep him&mdash;there&mdash;&rdquo; the judge
      extended his fat hands, &ldquo;at arm's length. I say to him metaphorically
      speaking&mdash;'so close, but no closer. I'll visit you when sick, I'll
      pray with you when dying, I'll chat with you, I'll eat with you, I'll
      smoke with you, and if need be, I'll drink with you&mdash;but be your
      intimate? Never! Why? Because be's a damned Yankee! These are the
      inextinguishable feelings of a gentleman. I am aware they are out of place
      in this age, but what's bred in the bone will show in the flesh. Who says
      it won't, is no gentleman himself and a liar as well! My place in the
      world was determined two or three hundred years ago, and my ancestors spat
      on such cattle as Mahaffy and they were flattered by the attention!&rdquo; The
      judge, powerfully excited by his denunciation of the unfortunate Mahaffy,
      quitted his chair and, lurching somewhat as he did so, began to pace the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me for your example, boy! You may be poor, you may possibly be
      hungry you'll often be thirsty, but through it all you will remain that
      splendid thing&mdash;a gentleman! Lands, niggers, riches, luxury, I've had
      'em all; I've sucked the good of 'em; they've colored my blood, they've
      gone into the fiber of my brain and body. Perhaps you'll contend that the
      old order is overthrown, that family has gone to the devil? You are right,
      and there's the pity of it! Where are the great names? A race of upstarts
      has taken their place&mdash;sons of nobody&mdash;nephews of nobody&mdash;cousins
      of nobody&mdash;I observe only deterioration in the trend of modern life.
      The social fabric is tottering&mdash;I can see it totter&mdash;&rdquo; and he
      tottered himself as he said this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had watched him out of wide eyes, as ponderous and unwieldy he
      shuffled back and forth in the dim candlelight; now shaking his head and
      muttering, the judge dropped into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm an old man-the spectacle won't long offend me. I'll die
      presently. The Bench and Bar will review my services to the country, the
      militia will fire a few volleys at my graveside, here and there a flag
      will be at half-mast, and that will be the end&mdash;&rdquo; He was so
      profoundly moved by the thought that he could not go on. His voice broke,
      and he buried his face in his arms. A sympathetic moisture had gathered in
      the child's eyes. He understood only a small part of what his host was
      saying, but realized that it had to do with death, and he had his own
      terrible acquaintance with death. He slipped from his chair and stole to
      the judge's side, and that gentleman felt a cool hand rest lightly on his
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said, glancing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm mighty sorry you're going to die,&rdquo; said the boy softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, Hannibal!&rdquo; cried the judge, looking wonderfully cheerful,
      despite his recent bitterness of spirit. &ldquo;I'm not experiencing any of the
      pangs of mortality now. My dissolution ain't a matter of to-night or
      to-morrow&mdash;there's some life in Slocum Price yet, for all the rough
      usage, eh? I've had my fun&mdash;I could tell you a thing or two about
      that, if you had hair on your chin!&rdquo; and the selfish lines of his face
      twisted themselves into an exceedingly knowing grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talked like you thought you were going to die right off,&rdquo; said
      Hannibal gravely, as he resumed his chair. The judge was touched. It had
      been more years than he cared to remember since he had launched a decent
      emotion in the breast of any human being. For a moment he was silent,
      struck with a sense of shame; then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure you are not running away, Hannibal? I hope you know that
      boys should always tell the truth&mdash;that hell has its own especial
      terrors for the boy who lies? Now, if I thought the worst of you, I might
      esteem it my duty to investigate your story.&rdquo; The judge laid a fat
      forefinger against the side of his nose, and regarded him with drunken
      gravity. Hannibal shook with terror. This was what he had feared. &ldquo;That's
      one aspect of the case. Now, on the other hand, I might draw up a legal
      instrument which could not fail to be of use to you on your travois, and
      would stop all questions. As for my fee, it would be trifling, when
      compared with the benefits I can see accruing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain't running away. I ain't got no one to run away from,&rdquo; said the
      boy chokingly. He was showing signs of fatigue. His head drooped and he
      met the judge's glance with tired, sleepy eyes. The latter looked at him
      and then said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you'd better go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I had,&rdquo; agreed Hannibal, slipping from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take my bed back of the quilt. You'll find a hoe there. You can dig
      up the dirt under the shuck tick with it&mdash;which helps astonishingly.
      What would the world say if it could know that judge Slocum Price makes
      his bed with a hoe! There's Spartan hardihood!&rdquo; but the boy, not knowing
      what was meant by Spartan hardihood, remained silent. &ldquo;Nearing threescore
      years and ten, the allotted span as set down by the Psalmist&mdash;once
      man of fashion, soldier, statesman and lawgiver&mdash;and makes his bed
      with a hoe! What a history!&rdquo; muttered the judge with weary melancholy, as
      one groping hand found the jug while the other found the glass. There was
      a pause, while he profited by this fortunate chance. &ldquo;Well, take the bed,&rdquo;
       he resumed hospitably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can sleep most anywhere. I ain't no ways particular,&rdquo; said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, take the bed!&rdquo; commanded the judge sternly. And Hannibal quickly
      retired behind the quilt. &ldquo;Do you find it comfortable?&rdquo; the judge asked,
      when the rustling of the shuck tick informed him that the child had lain
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you said your prayers?&rdquo; inquired the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I ain't said 'em yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, say them now. Religion is as becoming in the young as it is
      respectable in the aged. I'll not disturb you to-night, for it is God's
      will that I should stay up and get very drunk.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X. BOON COMPANIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some time later the judge was aware of a step on the path beyond his door,
      and glancing up, saw the tall figure of a man pause on his threshold. A
      whispered curse slipped from between his lips. Aloud he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Mahaffy?&rdquo; He got no reply, but the tall figure,
      propelled by very long legs, stalked into the shanty and a pair of keen,
      restless eyes deeply set under a high, bald head were bent curiously upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it I'm intruding,&rdquo; the new-comer said sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you think that, Solomon Mahaffy? When has my door been closed
      on you?&rdquo; the judge asked, but there was a guilty deepening of the flush on
      his face. Mr. Mahaffy glanced at the jug, at the half-emptied glass within
      convenient reach of the judge's hand, lastly at the judge himself, on
      whose flame-colored visage his eyes rested longest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard said there was honor among thieves,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know of no one better fitted to offer an opinion on so delicate a point
      than just yourself, Mahaffy,&rdquo; said the judge, with a thick little ripple
      of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Solomon Mahaffy's long face did not relax in its set expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw your light,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but you seem to be raising first-rate
      hell all by yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, be reasonable, Solomon. You'd gone down to the steamboat landing,&rdquo;
       said the judge plaintively. By way of answer, Mahaffy shot him a
      contemptuous glance. &ldquo;Take a chair&mdash;do, Solomon!&rdquo; entreated the
      judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't force my society on any man, Mr. Price,&rdquo; said Mahaffy, with
      austere hostility of tone. The judge winced at the &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; That registered
      the extreme of Mahaffy's disfavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel bitter about this, Solomon?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Mahaffy, in a tone of utter finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll feel better with three fingers of this trickling through your
      system,&rdquo; observed the judge, pushing a glass toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did I ever sneak a jug into my shanty?&rdquo; asked Mahaffy sternly,
      evidently conscious of entire rectitude in this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deplore your choice of words, Solomon,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;You know damn
      well that if you'd been here I couldn't have got past your place with that
      jug! But let's deal with conditions. Here's the jug, with some liquor left
      in it&mdash;here's a glass. Now what more do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I ever been caught like this?&rdquo; demanded Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you've invariably manifested the honorable disabilities of a
      gentleman. But don't set it all down to virtue. Maybe you haven't had the
      opportunity, maybe the temptation never came and found you weak and
      thirsty. Put away your sinful pride, Solomon&mdash;a sot like you has no
      business with the little niceties of selfrespect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I drink alone?&rdquo; insisted Mahaffy doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never give you the chance,&rdquo; retorted his friend. Mr. Mahaffy drew near
      the table. &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; urged the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you feel mean?&rdquo; said Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it's any satisfaction to you, I do,&rdquo; admitted the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to.&rdquo; Mahaffy drew forward a chair. The judge filled his glass.
      But Mr. Mahaffy's lean face, with its long jaws and high cheek-bones, over
      which the sallow skin was tightly drawn, did not relax in its forbidding
      expression, even when he had tossed off his first glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love to see you in a perfectly natural attitude like that, Solomon,
      with your arm crooked. What's the news from the landing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy brought his fist down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard the boat churning away round back of the bend, then I saw the
      lights, and she tied up and they tossed off the freight. Then she churned
      away again and her lights got back of the trees on the bank. There was the
      lap of waves on the shore, and I was left with the half-dozen miserable
      loafers who'd crawled out to see the boat come in. That's the news six
      days a week!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the river had come the judge, tentatively hopeful, but at heart
      expecting nothing, therefore immune to disappointment and equipped for
      failure. By the river had come Mr. Mahaffy, as unfit as the judge himself,
      and for the same reason, but sour and bitter with the world, believing
      always in the possibility of some miracle of regeneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleasantville's weekly paper, The Genius of Liberty, had dwelt at length
      upon those distinguished services judge Slocum Price had rendered the
      nation in war and peace, the judge having graciously furnished an array of
      facts otherwise difficult of access. That he was drunk at the time had but
      added to the splendor of the narrative. He had placed his ripe wisdom, the
      talents he had so assiduously cultivated, at the services of his fellow
      citizens. He was prepared to represent them in any or all the courts. But
      he had remained undisturbed in his condition of preparedness; that erudite
      brain was unconcerned with any problem beyond financing his thirst at the
      tavern, where presently ingenuity, though it expressed itself with a
      silver tongue, failed him, and he realized that the river's spent floods
      had left him stranded with those other odds and ends of worthless drift
      that cumbered its sun-scorched mud banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of all this passed through his mind as he sat there sodden and
      dreamy, with the one fierce need of his nature quieted for the moment. He
      had been stranded before, many times, in those long years during which he
      had moved steadily toward a diminishing heritage; indeed, nothing that was
      evil could contain the shock of a new experience. He had fought and lost
      all his battles&mdash;bitter struggles to think of even now, after the
      lapse of years, and the little he had to tell of himself was an intricate
      mingling of truth and falsehood, grotesque exaggeration, purposeless
      mendacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Mahaffy had met exactly one month before, on the deck of the
      steamer from which they had been put ashore at the river landing two miles
      from Pleasantville. Mahaffy's historic era had begun just there.
      Apparently he had no past of which he could be brought to speak. He
      admitted having been born in Boston some sixty years before, and was a
      printer by trade; further than this, he had not revealed himself, drunk or
      sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the judge's elbow Mr. Mahaffy changed his position with nervous
      suddenness. Then he folded his long arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked if there was any news, Price; while we were waiting for the
      boat a raft tied up to the bank; the fellow aboard of it had a man he'd
      fished up out of the river, a man who'd been pretty well cut to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; asked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knew, and he wasn't conscious. I shouldn't be surprised if he
      never opens his lips again. When the doctor had looked to his cuts, the
      fellow on the raft cast off and went on down the Elk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to the judge that he himself had news to impart. He must
      account for the boy's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While you've been taking your whiff of life down at the steamboat
      landing, Mahaffy, I've been experiencing a most extraordinary
      coincidence.&rdquo; The judge paused. By a sullen glare in his deep-sunk eyes
      Mr. Mahaffy seemed to bid him go on. &ldquo;Back east&mdash;&rdquo; the judge jerked
      his thumb with an indefinite gesture &ldquo;back east at my ancestral home&mdash;&rdquo;
       Mahaffy snorted harshly. &ldquo;You don't believe I had an ancestral home?&mdash;well,
      I had! It was of brick, sir, with eight Corinthian columns across the
      front, having a spacious paneled hall sixty feet long. I had the
      distinguished honor to entertain General Andrew Jackson there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get those dimensions out of the jug?&rdquo; inquiry Mahaffy, with a
      frightful bark that was intended for a sarcastic laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, it is not in your province to judge me by my present degraded
      associates. Near the house I have described&mdash;my father's and his
      father's before him, and mine now&mdash;but for the unparalleled
      misfortunes which have pursued me&mdash;lived a family by the name of
      Hazard. And when I went to the war of '12&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you in that bloody time, a sutler?&rdquo; inquired Mahaffy
      insultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir&mdash;a colonel of infantry!&mdash;I say, when I went to the war,
      one of these Hazards accompanied me as my orderly. His grandson is back of
      that curtain now&mdash;asleep&mdash;in my bed!&rdquo; Mahaffy put down his
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were like this once before,&rdquo; he said darkly. But at that instant the
      shuck tick rattled noisily at some movement of the sleeping boy. Mahaffy
      quitted his chair, and crossing the room, drew the quilt aside. A glance
      sufficed to assure him that in part, at least, the judge spoke the truth.
      He let the curtain fall into place and resumed his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's an orphan, Solomon; a poor, friendless orphan. Another might have
      turned him away from his door&mdash;I didn't; I hadn't the heart to. I
      bespeak your sympathy for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I just told you?&rdquo; said the judge reproachfully. Mahaffy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've told me something. Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Hannibal Wayne Hazard. Wait until he wakes up and see if it
      isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure he isn't kin to you?&rdquo; said Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a drop of my blood flows in the veins of any living creature,&rdquo;
       declared the judge with melancholy impressiveness. He continued with
      deepening feeling, &ldquo;All I shall leave to posterity is my fame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking of posterity, which isn't present, Mr. Price, I'll say it is
      embarrassed by the attention,&rdquo; observed Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence between them. Mr. Mahaffy drank, and when he did
      not drink he bit his under lip and studied the judge. This was always
      distressing to the latter gentleman. Mahaffy's silence he could never
      penetrate. What was back of it&mdash;judgment, criticism, disbelief&mdash;what?
      Or was it the silence of emptiness? Was Mahaffy dumb merely because he
      could think of nothing to say, or did his silence cloak his feelings-and
      what were his feelings? Did his meditations outrun his habitually
      insulting speech as he bit his under lip and glared at him? The judge
      always felt impelled to talk at such times, while Mahaffy, by that silence
      of his, seemed to weigh and condemn whatever he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon had slipped below the horizon. Pleasantville had long since gone
      to bed; it was only the judge's window that gave its light to the
      blackness of the night. There was a hoofbeat on the road. It came nearer
      and nearer, and presently sounded just beyond the door. Then it ceased,
      and a voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, there!&rdquo; The judge scrambled to his feet, and taking up the candle,
      stepped, or rather staggered, into the yard. Mahaffy followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's wanted?&rdquo; asked the judge, as he lurched up to horse and rider,
      holding his candle aloft. The light showed a tail fellow mounted on a
      handsome bay horse. It was Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there an inn hereabouts?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find one down the road a ways,&rdquo; said Mahaffy. The judge said
      nothing. He was staring up at Murrell with drunken gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have either of you gentlemen seen a boy go through here to-day? A boy
      about ten years old?&rdquo; Murrell glanced from one to the other. Mr. Mahaffy's
      thin lips twisted themselves into a sarcastic smile. He turned to the
      judge, who spoke up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he carry a bundle and rifle?&rdquo; he asked. Murrell gave eager assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;he stopped here along about four o'clock and
      asked his way to the nearest river landing.&rdquo; Murrell gathered up his
      reins, and then that fixed stare of the judge's seemed to arrest his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll know me again,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that's a satisfaction to you,&rdquo; said Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't&mdash;none whatever,&rdquo; answered the judge promptly. &ldquo;For I don't
      value you&mdash;I don't value you that much!&rdquo; and he snapped his fingers
      to illustrate his meaning.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI. THE ORATOR Or THE DAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannibal!&rdquo; the judge's voice and manner were rather stern. &ldquo;Hannibal, a
      man rode by here last night on a big bay horse. He said he was looking for
      a boy about ten years old&mdash;a boy with a bundle and rifle.&rdquo; There was
      an awful pause. Hannibal's heart stood still for a brief instant, then it
      began to beat with terrific thumps against his ribs. &ldquo;Who was that man,
      Hannibal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;please, I don't know&mdash;&rdquo; gasped the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannibal, who was that man?&rdquo; repeated the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were Captain Murrell.&rdquo; The judge regarded him with a look of great
      steadiness. He saw his small face go white, he saw the look of abject
      terror in his eyes. The judge raised his fist and brought it down with a
      great crash on the table, so that the breakfast dishes leaped and rattled.
      &ldquo;We don't know any boy ten years old with a rifle and bundle!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please&mdash;you won't let him take me away, judge I want to stop with
      you!&rdquo; cried Hannibal. He slipped from his chair, and passing about the
      table, seized the judge by the hand. The judge was visibly affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he roared, with a great oath. &ldquo;He shan't have you&mdash;I'll see him
      in the farthest corner of hell first! Is he kin to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took you to raise, did he&mdash;and abused you&mdash;infernal hypocrite!&rdquo;
       cried the judge with righteous wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tried to get me away from my Uncle Bob. He's been following us since
      we crossed the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your Uncle Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's dead.&rdquo; And the child began to weep bitterly. Much puzzled, the judge
      regarded him in silence for a moment, then bent and lifted him into his
      lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, my son&mdash;&rdquo; he said soothingly. &ldquo;Now you tell me when he died,
      and all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He were killed. It were only yesterday, and I can't forget him! I don't
      want to&mdash;but it hurts&mdash;it hurts terrible!&rdquo; Hannibal buried his
      head in the judge's shoulder and sobbed aloud. Presently his small hands
      stole about the judge's neck, and that gentleman experienced a strange
      thrill of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me how he died, Hannibal,&rdquo; he urged gently. In a voice broken by
      sobs the child began the story of their flight, a confused narrative,
      which the judge followed with many a puzzled shake of the head. But as he
      reached his climax&mdash;that cry he had heard at the tavern, the men in
      the lane with their burden&mdash;he became more and more coherent and his
      ideas clothed themselves in words of dreadful simplicity and directness.
      The judge shuddered. &ldquo;Can such things be?&rdquo; he murmured at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't let him take me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never unsay my words,&rdquo; said the judge grandly. &ldquo;With God's help I'll be
      the instrument for their destruction.&rdquo; He frowned with a preternatural
      severity. Eh&mdash;if he could turn a trick like that, it would pull him
      up! There would be no more jeers and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      What credit and standing it would give him! His thoughts slipped along
      this fresh channel. What a prosecution he would conduct&mdash;what a
      whirlwind of eloquence he would loose! He began to breathe hard. His name
      should go from end to end of the state! No man could be great without
      opportunity&mdash;for years he had known this&mdash;but here was
      opportunity at last! Then he remembered what Mahaffy had told him of the
      man on the raft. This Slosson's tavern was probably on the upper waters of
      the Elk. Yancy had been thrown in the river and had been picked up in a
      dying condition. &ldquo;Hannibal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Solomon Mahaffy, who was here last
      night, told me he saw down at the river landing, a man who had been fished
      up out of the Elk&mdash;a man who had been roughly handled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were it my Uncle Bob?&rdquo; cried Hannibal, lifting a swollen face to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear lad, I don't know,&rdquo; said the judge sympathetically. &ldquo;Some people on
      a raft had picked him up out of the river. He was unconscious and no one
      knew him. He was apparently a stranger in these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were Uncle Bob! It were Uncle Bob&mdash;I know it were my Uncle Bob! I
      must go find him!&rdquo; and Hannibal slipped from the judge's lap and ran for
      his rifle and bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a bit!&rdquo; cried the judge. &ldquo;He was taken on past here, and he was
      badly injured. Now, if it was your Uncle Bob, he'll come back the moment
      he is able to travel. Meantime, you must remain under my protection while
      we investigate this man Slosson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But alas&mdash;that thoroughfare which is supposed to be paved exclusively
      with good resolutions, had benefited greatly by Slocum Price's labors in
      the past, and he was destined to toil still in its up-keep. He borrowed
      the child's money and spent it, and if any sense of shame smote his torpid
      conscience, he hid it manfully. Not so Mr. Mahaffy; for while he profited
      by his friend's act, he told that gentleman just what he thought of him
      with insulting candor. On the eighth day there was sobriety for the pair.
      Deep gloom visited Mr. Mahaffy, and the judge was a prey to melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Saturday, and in Pleasantville a jail-raising was in progress.
      During all the years of its corporate dignity the village had never
      boasted any building where the evil-doer could be placed under restraint;
      hence had arisen its peculiar habit of dealing with crime; but a leading
      citizen had donated half an acre of ground lying midway between the town
      and the river landing as a site for the proposed structure, and the
      scattered population of the region had assembled for the raising. Nor was
      Pleasantville unprepared to make immediate use of the jail, since the
      sheriff had in custody a free negro who had knifed another free negro and
      was awaiting trial at the next term of court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't want to get there too early,&rdquo; explained the judge, as they
      quitted the cabin. &ldquo;We want to miss the work, but be on hand for the
      celebration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we may confidently look to you to favor us with a few eloquent
      words?&rdquo; said Mr. Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not, Solomon?&rdquo; asked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, indeed!&rdquo; echoed Mr. Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunity he craved was not denied him. The crowd was like most
      southwestern crowds of the period, and no sooner did the judge appear than
      there were clamorous demands for a speech. He cast a glance of triumph at
      Mahaffy, and nimbly mounted a convenient stump. He extolled the climate of
      middle Tennessee, the unsurpassed fertility of the soil; he touched on the
      future that awaited Pleasantville; he apostrophized the jail; this simple
      structure of logs in the shadow of the primeval woods was significant of
      their love of justice and order; it was a suitable place for the detention
      of a citizen of a great republic; it was no mediaeval dungeon, but a
      forest-embowered retreat where, barring mosquitoes and malaria, the party
      under restraint would be put to no needless hardship; he would have the
      occasional companionship of the gentlemanly sheriff; his friends, with
      such wise and proper restrictions as the law saw fit to impose, could come
      and impart the news of the day to him through the chinks of the logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you have dealt in a hasty fashion with one or two
      horse-thieves,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Also with a gambler who was put ashore here
      from a river packet and subsequently became involved in a dispute with a
      late citizen of this place touching the number of aces in a pack of cards.
      It is not for me to criticize! What I may term the spontaneous love of
      justice is the brightest heritage of a free people. It is this same
      commendable ability to acquit ourselves of our obligations that is making
      us the wonder of the world! But don't let us forget the law&mdash;of which
      it is an axiom, that it is not the severity of punishment, but the
      certainty of it, that holds the wrong-doer in check! With this safe and
      commodious asylum the plow line can remain the exclusive aid to
      agriculture. If a man murders, curb your natural impulse! Give him a fair
      trial, with eminent counsel!&rdquo; The judge tried not to look self-conscious
      when he said this. &ldquo;If he is found guilty, I still say, don't lynch him!
      Why? Because by your hasty act you deny the public the elevating and
      improving spectacle of a legal execution!&rdquo; When the applause had died out,
      a lank countryman craning his neck for a sight of the sheriff, bawled out
      over the heads of the crowd:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's your nigger? We want to put him in here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he's gone fishin'. I never seen the beat of that nigger to go
      fishin',&rdquo; said the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoop! Ain't you goin' to put him in here?&rdquo; yelled the countryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a mighty lonely spot for a nigger,&rdquo; said the sheriff doubtingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lonely? Well, suppose he ups and lopes out of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know that nigger,&rdquo; rejoined the sheriff warmly. &ldquo;He ain't
      missed a meal since I had him in custody. Just as regular as the clock
      strikes he's at the back door. Good habits&mdash;why, that darky is a
      lesson to most white folks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care a cuss about that nigger, but what's the use of building a
      jail if a body ain't goin' to use it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's some sense in that,&rdquo; agreed the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a whole heap of sense in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggest&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker was a young lawyer from the next county&mdash;&ldquo;I
      suggest that a committee be appointed to wait on the nigger at the
      steamboat landing and acquaint him with the fact that with his assistance
      we wish completely to furnish the jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I protest&mdash;&rdquo; cried the judge. &ldquo;I protest&mdash;&rdquo; he repeated
      vigorously. &ldquo;Pride of race forbids that I should be a party to the
      degradation of the best of civilization! Is your jail to be christened to
      its high office by a nigger? Is this to be the law's apotheosis? No, sir!
      No nigger is worthy the honor of being the first prisoner here!&rdquo; This was
      a new and striking idea. The crowd regarded the judge admiringly.
      Certainly here was a man of refined feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just the way I feel about it,&rdquo; said the sheriff. &ldquo;If I'd athought
      there was any call for him I wouldn't have let him go fishing, I'd have
      kept him about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let the nigger fish&mdash;he has powerful luck. What's he usin',
      Sheriff; worms or minnies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worms,&rdquo; said the sheriff shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the crowd drifted away in the direction of the tavern. Hannibal
      meantime had gone down to the river. He haunted its banks as though he
      expected to see his Uncle Bob appear any moment. The judge and Mahaffy had
      mingled with the others in the hope of free drinks, but in this hope there
      lurked the germ of a bitter disappointment. There was plenty of drinking,
      but they were not invited to join in this pleasing rite, and after a
      period of great mental anguish Mahaffy parted with the last stray coin in
      the pocket of his respectable black trousers, and while his flask was
      being filled the judge indulged in certain winsome gallantries with the
      fat landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La, Judge Price, how you do run on!&rdquo; she said with a coquettish toss of
      her curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the charm of you, ma'am,&rdquo; said the judge. He leaned across the bar
      and, sinking his voice to a husky whisper, asked, &ldquo;Would it be perfectly
      convenient for you to extend me a limited credit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Judge Price, you know a heap better than to ask me that!&rdquo; she
      answered, shaking her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offense, ma'am,&rdquo; said the judge, hiding his disappointment, and with
      Mahaffy he quitted the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you marry the old girl? You could drink yourself to death in
      six months,&rdquo; said Mahaffy. &ldquo;That would be a speculation worth while&mdash;and
      while you live you could fondle those curls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I'll be forced to it yet,&rdquo; responded the judge with gloomy
      pessimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the filling of Mahaffy's flask the important event of the day was
      past, and both knew it was likely to retain its preeminence for a terrible
      and indefinite period; a thought that enriched their thirst as it
      increased their gravity while they were traversing the stretch of dusty
      road that lay between the cavern and the judge's shanty. When they had
      settled themselves in their chairs before the door, Mahaffy, who was
      notably jealous of his privileges, drew the cork from the flask and took
      the first pull at its contents. The judge counted the swallows as
      registered by that useful portion of Mahaffy's anatomy known as his Adam's
      apple. After a breathless interval, Mahaffy detached himself from the
      flask and civilly passing the cuff of his coat about its neck, handed it
      over to the judge. In the unbroken silence that succeeded the flask passed
      swiftly from hand to hand, at length Mahaffy held it up to the light. It
      was two-thirds empty, and a sigh stole from between his thin lips. The
      judge reached out a tremulous hand. He was only too familiar with his
      friend's distressing peculiarities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet!&rdquo; he begged thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Mahaffy fiercely. &ldquo;Is it your liquor or mine?&rdquo; He
      quitted his chair end stalked to the well where he filled the flask with
      water. Infinitely disgusted, the judge watched the sacrilege. Mahaffy
      resumed his chair and again the flask went its rounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't so bad,&rdquo; said the judge after a time, but with a noticeable lack
      of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you in shape to put anything better than water into it, Mr. Price?&rdquo;
       The judge winced. He always winced at that &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wouldn't serve myself such a trick as that,&rdquo; he said with
      decision. &ldquo;When I take liquor, it's one thing; and when I want water, it's
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drink as much clear water as is good for a man of my constitution,&rdquo;
       said the judge combatively. &ldquo;My talents are wasted here,&rdquo; he resumed,
      after a little pause. &ldquo;I've brought them the blessings of the law, but
      what does it signify!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you ever come here?&rdquo; Mahaffy spoke sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might ask the same question of you, and in the same offensive tone,&rdquo;
       said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask, not wishing to take a liberty, were you always the same old
      pauper you've been since I've known you?&rdquo; inquired Mahaffy. The judge
      maintained a stony silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat deepened in the heart of the afternoon. The sun, a ball of fire,
      slipped back of the tree-tops. Thick shadows stole across the stretch of
      dusty road. Off in the distance there was the sound of cowbell. Slowly
      these came nearer and nearer&mdash;as the golden light slanted, sifting
      deeper and deeper into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could see the crowd that came and went about the tavern, they caught
      the distant echo of its mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Common&mdash;quite common,&rdquo; said the judge with somber melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't see anything common,&rdquo; said Mahaffy sourly. &ldquo;The drinks weren't
      common by a long sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I referred to the gathering in its social aspect, Solomon,&rdquo; explained the
      judge; &ldquo;the illiberal spirit that prevailed, which, I observe, did not
      escape you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skunks!&rdquo; said Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a man present had the public spirit to set 'em up,&rdquo; lamented the
      judge. &ldquo;They drank in pairs, and I'd blistered my throat at their damn
      jail-raising! What sort of a fizzle would it have been if I hadn't been on
      hand to impart distinction to the occasion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't begrudge 'em their liquor,&rdquo; said Mahaffy with acid dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; interrupted the judge. &ldquo;I hope it's poison to 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be in the long run, if it's any comfort to you to know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no comfort, it's not near quick enough,&rdquo; said the judge
      relentlessly. The sudden noisy clamor of many voices, highpitched and
      excited, floated out to them under the hot sky. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; began
      the judge, and paused as he saw the crowd stream into the road before the
      tavern. Then a cloud of dust enveloped it, a cloud of dust that came from
      the trampling of many pairs of feet, and that swept toward them, thick and
      impenetrable, and no higher than a tall man's head in the lifeless air. &ldquo;I
      wonder if we missed anything,&rdquo; continued the judge, finishing what he had
      started to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The score or more of men were quite near, and the judge and Mahaffy made
      out the tall figure of the sheriff in the lead. And then the crowd, very
      excited, very dusty, very noisy and very hot, flowed into the judge's
      front yard. For a brief moment that gentleman fancied Pleasantville had
      awakened to a fitting sense of its obligation to him and that it was about
      to make amends for its churlish lack of hospitality. He rose from his
      chair, and with a splendid florid gesture, swept off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the pussy fellow!&rdquo; cried a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut up&mdash;don't you think I know him?&rdquo; retorted the sheriff
      tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen&mdash;&rdquo; began the judge blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get the well-rope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge was rather at loss properly to interpret these varied remarks.
      He was not long left in doubt. The sheriff stepped to his side and dropped
      a heavy hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Slocum Price, or whatever your name is, your little game is up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get the well-rope! Oh, hell&mdash;won't some one get the well-rope?&rdquo; The
      voice rose into a wail of entreaty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge's eyes, rather startled, slid around in their sockets. Clearly
      something was wrong&mdash;but what&mdash;what?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't he bold?&rdquo; it was a woman's voice this time, and the fat landlady,
      her curls awry and her plump breast heaving tumultuously, gained a place
      in the forefront of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear madam, this is an unexpected pleasure!&rdquo; said the judge, with his
      hand upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you make your wicked old sheep's eyes at me, you brazen thing!&rdquo;
       cried the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're wanted,&rdquo; said the sheriff grimly, still keeping his hand on the
      judge's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; demanded the judge thickly. The sheriff had no time in which
      to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want my money!&rdquo; shrieked the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your money&mdash;Mrs. Walker, you amaze me!&rdquo; The judge drew himself up
      haughtily, in genuine astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want my money!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Walker in even more piercing tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not aware that I owe you anything, madam. Thank God, I hold your
      receipted bill of recent date,&rdquo; answered the judge with chilling dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good money&mdash;not this worthless trash!&rdquo; she shook a bill under his
      nose. The judge recognized it as the one of which he had despoiled
      Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been catched passing counterfeit,&rdquo; said the sheriff. A light
      broke on the judge, a light that dazzled and stunned. An officious and
      impatient gentleman tossed a looped end of the well-rope about his neck
      and the crowd yelled excitedly. This was something like&mdash;it had a
      taste for the man-hunt! The sheriff snatched away the rope and dealt the
      officious gentleman a savage blow on the chin that sent him staggering
      backward into the arms of his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here, now&mdash;I'm going to arrest this old faller! I am going
      to put him in jail, and I ain't going to have no nonsense&mdash;do you
      hear me?&rdquo; he expostulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can explain&mdash;&rdquo; cried the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make him give me my money!&rdquo; wailed Mrs Walker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jezebel!&rdquo; roared the judge, in a passion of rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ca'm's the word, or you'll get 'em started!&rdquo; whispered the sheriff. The
      judge looked fearfully around. At his side stood Mahaffy, a yellow pallor
      splotching his thin cheeks. He seemed to be holding himself there by an
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to them, Solomon&mdash;speak to them&mdash;you know how I came by
      the money! Speak to them&mdash;you know I am innocent!&rdquo; cried the judge,
      clutching his friend by the arm. Mahaffy opened his thin lips, but the
      crowd drowned his voice in a roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's his partner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no evidence against him,&rdquo; said the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall fellow, in a fringed hunting-shirt, shook a long finger under
      Mahaffy's aquiline nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoot&mdash;that's what&mdash;you make tracks! And if we ever see
      your ugly face about here again, we'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll what?&rdquo; inquired Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll fix you out with feathers that won't molt, that's what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mahaffy seemed to hesitate. His lean hands opened and closed, and he
      met the eyes of the crowd with a bitter, venomous stare. Some one gave him
      a shove and he staggered forward a step, snapping out a curse. Before he
      could recover himself the shove was repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lope on out of here!&rdquo; yelled the tall fellow, who had first challenged
      his right to remain in Pleasantville or its environs. As the crowd fell
      apart to make way for him, willing hands were extended to give him the
      needed impetus, and without special volition of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy was hurried toward the road. His hat was knocked flat on his head&mdash;he
      turned with an angry snarl, the very embodiment of hate&mdash;but again he
      was thrust forward. And then, somehow, his walk became a run and the crowd
      started after him with delighted whoopings. Once more, and for the last
      time, he faced about, giving the judge a hopeless, despairing glance. His
      tormentors were snatching up sods and stones and he had no choice. He
      turned, his long strides taking him swiftly over the ground, with the air
      full of missiles at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had gone a hundred yards he abandoned the road and, turning off
      across an unfenced field, ran toward the woods and swampy bottom. Twenty
      men were in chase behind him. The judge was the sheriff's prisoner&mdash;that
      official had settled that point&mdash;but Mr. Mahaffy was common property,
      it was his cruel privilege to furnish excitement; his keen rage was almost
      equal to the fear that urged him on. Then the woods closed about him. His
      long legs, working tirelessly, carried him over fallen logs and through
      tall tangled thickets, the voices behind him growing more and more distant
      as he ran.

      CHAPTER XII. THE FAMILY ON THE RAFT

    <p>
      That would unquestionably have been the end of Bob Yancy when he was shot
      out into the muddy waters of the Elk River, had not Mr. Richard Keppel
      Cavendish, variously known as Long-Legged Dick, and Chills-and-Fever
      Cavendish, of Lincoln County, in the state of Tennessee, some months
      previously and after unprecedented mental effort on his part, decided that
      Lincoln County was no place for him. When he had established this idea
      firmly in his own mind and in the mind of Polly, his wife, he set about
      solving the problem of transportation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cavendish's paternal grandparent had drifted down the Holston and
      Tennessee; and Mr. Cavendish's father, in his son's youth, had poled up
      the Elk. Mr. Cavendish now determined to float down the Elk to its
      juncture with the Tennessee, down the Tennessee to the Ohio, and if need
      be, down the Ohio to the Mississippi, and keep drifting until he found
      some spot exactly suited to his taste. Temperamentally, he was well
      adapted to drifting. No conception of vicarious activity could have been
      more congenial.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this end in view he had toiled through late winter and early spring,
      building himself a raft on which to transport his few belongings and his
      numerous family; there were six little Cavendishes, and they ranged in
      years from four to eleven; there was in addition the baby, who was always
      enumerated separately. This particular infant Mr. Cavendish said he
      wouldn't take a million dollars for. He usually added feelingly that he
      wouldn't give a piece of chalk for another one.
    </p>
    <p>
      June found him aboard his raft with all his earthly possessions bestowed
      about him, awaiting the rains and freshets that were to waft him
      effortless into a newer country where he should have a white man's chance.
      At last the rains came, and he cast off from the bank at that unsalubrious
      spot where his father had elected to build his cabin on a strip of level
      bottom subject to periodic inundation. Wishing fully to profit by the
      floods and reach the big water without delay, Cavendish ran the raft
      twenty-four hours at a stretch, sleeping by day while Polly managed the
      great sweep, only calling him when some dangerous bit of the river was to
      be navigated. Thus it happened that as Murrell and Slosson were dragging
      Yancy down the lane, Cavendish was just rounding a bend in the Elk, a
      quarter of a mile distant. Leaning loosely against the long handle of his
      sweep, he was watching the lane of bright water that ran between the black
      shadows cast by the trees on either bank. He was in shirt and trousers,
      barefoot and bareheaded, and his face, mild and contemplative, wore an
      expression of dreamy contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly its expression changed. He became alert and watchful. He had
      heard a dull splash. Thinking that some tree had been swept into the
      flood, he sought to pierce the darkness that lay along the shore. Five or
      six minutes passed as the raft glided along without sound. He was about to
      relapse into his former attitude of listless ease when he caught sight of
      some object in the eddy that swept alongside. Mr. Cavendish promptly
      detached himself from the handle of the sweep and ran to the edge of the
      raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord&mdash;what's that!&rdquo; he gasped, but he already knew it was a
      face, livid and blood-streaked. Dropping on his knees he reached out a
      pair of long arms and made a dexterous grab, and his fingers closed on the
      collar of Yancy's shirt. &ldquo;Neighbor, I certainly have got you!&rdquo; said
      Cavendish, between his teeth. He drew Yancy close alongside the raft, and,
      slipping a hand under each arm, pulled him clear of the water. The swift
      current swept the raft on down the stream. It rode fairly in the center of
      the lane of light, but no eye had observed its passing. Mr. Cavendish
      stood erect and stared down at the blood-stained face, then he dropped on
      his knees again and began a hurried examination of the still figure.
      &ldquo;There's a little life here&mdash;not much, but some&mdash;you was well
      worth fishing up!&rdquo; he said approvingly, after a brief interval. &ldquo;Polly!&rdquo;
       he called, raising his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought Mrs. Cavendish from one of the two cabins that occupied the
      center of the raft. She was a young woman, still very comely, though of a
      matronly plumpness. She was in her nightgown, and when she caught sight of
      Yancy she uttered a shriek and fled back into the shanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Dick, you might ha' told a body you wa'n't alone!&rdquo; she said
      reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cry had aroused the other denizens of the raft. The tow heads of the
      six little Cavendishes rose promptly from a long bolster in the smaller of
      the two shanties, and as promptly six little Cavendishes, each draped in a
      single non-committal garment, apparently cut by one pattern and not at all
      according to the wearer's years or length of limb, tumbled forth from
      their shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho', Polly, he's senseless! But you dress and come here quick. Now, you
      young folks, don't you tetch him!&rdquo; for the six small Cavendishes, excited
      beyond measure, were crowding and shoving for a nearer sight of Yancy.
      They began to pelt their father with questions. Who was it? Sho', in the
      river? Sho', all cut up like that&mdash;who'd cut him? Had he hurt
      himself? Was he throwed in? When did pop fish him out? Was he dead? Why
      did he lay like that and not move or speak&mdash;sho'! This and much more
      was flung at Mr. Cavendish all in one breath, and each eager questioner
      seized him by the hand, the dangling sleeve of his shirt, or his trousers&mdash;they
      clutched him from all sides. &ldquo;I never seen such a family!&rdquo; said Mr.
      Cavendish helplessly. &ldquo;Now, you-all shut up, or I 'low I'll lay into you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Cavendish's appearance created a diversion in his favor. The six
      rushed on her tumultously. They seized her hands or struggled for a
      fragment of her skirt to hold while they poured out their tale. Pop had
      fished up a man&mdash;he'd been throwed in the river! Pop didn't know if
      he was dead or not&mdash;he was all cut and bloody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, I've a mind to skin you if you don't keep still! Miss
      Constance,&rdquo; Polly addressed her eldest child, &ldquo;I'm surprised at you! You
      might be a heathen savage for all you got on your back&mdash;get into some
      duds this instant!&rdquo; Cavendish was on his knees again beside Yancy, and
      Polly, by a determined effort, rid herself of the children. &ldquo;Why, he's a
      grand-looking man, ain't he?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;La, what a pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can feel his heart beat, and he's bleeding some,&rdquo; said Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see&mdash;just barely flutters, don't it? Henry, go mind the sweep
      and see we don't get aground! Keppel, you start a fire and warm some
      water! Connie, you tear up my other petticoat for bandages now, stir
      around, all of you!&rdquo; And then began a period of breathless activity. They
      first lifted Yancy into the circle of illumination cast by the fire Keppel
      had started on the hearth of flat stones before the shanties. Then, with
      Constance to hold a pan of warm water, Mrs. Cavendish deftly bathed the
      gaping wound in Yancy's shoulder where Murrell had driven his knife. This
      she bandaged with strips torn from her petticoat. Next she began on the
      ragged cut left by Slosson's club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got a right to be dead!&rdquo; said Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get the shears, Dick&mdash;I must snip away some of his hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this while the four half-naked youngest Cavendishes, very still now,
      stood about the stone hearth in the chill dawn and watched their mother's
      surgery with a breathless interest. Only the outcast Henry at the sweep
      ever and anon lifted his voice between sobs of mingled rage and
      disappointment, and demanded what was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think he is going to die, Polly?&rdquo; whispered Cavendish at length. Their
      heads, hers very black and glossy, his very blond, were close together as
      they bent above the injured man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never say a body's going to die until he's dead,&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;He's
      still breathing, and a Christian has got to do what they can. Don't you
      think you ought to tie up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The freshet's leaving us. I'll run until we hit the big water down by
      Pleasantville, and then tie up,&rdquo; said Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon we'd better lift him on to one of the beds&mdash;get his wet
      clothes off and wrap him up warm,&rdquo; said Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, put him in our bed!&rdquo; cried all the little Cavendishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Yancy was borne into the smaller of the two shanties, where presently
      his bandaged head rested on the long communal pillow. Then his wet clothes
      were hung up to dry along with a portion of the family wash which
      fluttered on a rope stretched between the two shanties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raft had all the appearance of a cabin dooryard. There was, in
      addition to the two shelters of bark built over a light framework of
      poles, a pen which housed a highly domestic family of pigs, while half a
      dozen chickens enjoyed a restricted liberty. With Yancy disposed of, the
      regular family life was resumed. It was sun-up now. The little
      Cavendishes, reluctant but overpersuaded, had their faces washed alongside
      and were dressed by Connie, while Mrs. Cavendish performed the same
      offices for the baby. Then there was breakfast, from which Mr. Cavendish
      rose yawning to go to bed, where, before dropping off to sleep, he played
      with the baby. This left Mrs. Cavendish in full command of her floating
      dooryard. She smoked a reflective pipe, watching the river between puffs,
      and occasionally lending a hand at the sweeps. Later the family wash
      engaged her. It had neither beginning nor end, but serialized itself from
      day to day. Connie was already proficient at the tubs. It was a knack she
      was in no danger of losing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keppel and Henry took turns at the sweeps, while the three smaller
      children began to manifest a love for the water they had not seemed to
      possess earlier in the day. They played along the edge of the raft, always
      in imminent danger of falling in, always being called back, or seized,
      just in time to prevent a catastrophe. This ceaseless activity on their
      part earned them much in the way of cuffings, chastisements which Mrs.
      Cavendish administered with no great spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drat you, why don't you go look at the pore gentleman instead of
      posterin' a body 'most to death!&rdquo; she demanded at length, and they stole
      off on tiptoe to stare at Yancy. Presently Richard ran to his mother's
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come quick&mdash;he's mutterin' and mumblin' and moving his head!&rdquo; he
      cried. It was as the child said. Yancy had roused from his heavy stupor.
      Words almost inaudible and quite inarticulate were issuing from his lips
      and there was a restless movement of his head on the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He 'pears powerful distressed about something,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cavendish. &ldquo;I
      reckon I'd better give him a little stimulant now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she was gone for the whisky, Connie, who had squatted down beside
      the bed, touched Yancy's hand which lay open. Instantly his fingers closed
      about hers and he was silent; the movement of his head ceased abruptly;
      but when she sought to withdraw her hand he began to murmur again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, what he wants is some one to sit beside him!&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Cavendish, who had returned with the whisky, a few drops of which she
      managed to force between Yancy's lips. All the rest of that day some one
      of the children sat beside the wounded man, who was quiet and satisfied
      just as long as there was a small hand for him to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be a family man,&rdquo; observed Mr. Cavendish when Polly told him of
      this. &ldquo;We'll tie up at Pleasantville landing and learn who he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had ought to have a doctor to look at them cuts of his,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late afternoon when the landing was reached. Half a score of men
      were loafing about the woodyard on shore. Mr. Cavendish made fast to a
      blasted tree, then he climbed the bank; the men regarding him incuriously
      as he approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; said Cavendish genially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; they answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where might I find the nearest doctor?&rdquo; inquired Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within about six foot of you,&rdquo; said one of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Briefly Cavendish told the story of Yancy's rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Doc, I want you should cast an eye over the way we've dressed his
      cuts, and I want the rest of you to come and take a look at him and tell
      who he is and where he belongs,&rdquo; he said in conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll know him if he belongs within forty miles of here in any direction,&rdquo;
       said the doctor. But he shook his head when his eye rested on Yancy.
      &ldquo;Never saw him,&rdquo; he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about them bandages, Doc?&rdquo; demanded Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I reckon they'll do,&rdquo; replied the doctor indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say. You'll know all about that inside the next forty-eight
      hours. Better let the rest have a look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just feel of them bandages&mdash;sho', I got money in my pants!&rdquo; Mr.
      Cavendish was rapidly losing his temper, yet he controlled himself until
      each man had taken a look at Yancy; but always with the same result&mdash;a
      shake of the head. &ldquo;I reckon I can leave him here?&rdquo; Cavendish asked, when
      the last man had looked and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him here&mdash;why?&rdquo; demanded the doctor slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm going on, that's why. I'm headed for downstream, and he ain't
      in any sort of shape to say whether he wants to go or stop,&rdquo; explained
      Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You picked him up, didn't you?&rdquo; asked one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly did,&rdquo; said Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon if you're so anxious for him to stay hereabout, you'd
      better stop, yourself,&rdquo; said the owner of the woodyard. &ldquo;There ain't a
      house within two miles of here but mine, and he don't go there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a healthy lot, you are!&rdquo; said Cavendish. &ldquo;I wonder your largeness
      of heart ain't ruptured your wishbones long ago!&rdquo; So saying, he retired to
      the stern of his raft and leaned against the sweep-handle, apparently lost
      in thought. His visitors climbed the bank and reestablished themselves on
      the wood-ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Mr. Cavendish lifted his voice and addressed Polly and the six
      little Cavendishes at the other end of the raft. He asserted that he was
      the only well-born man within a radius of perhaps a hundred miles&mdash;he
      excepted no one. He knew who his father and mother were, and they had been
      legally married&mdash;he seemed to infer that this was not always the
      case. Mr. Cavendish glanced toward the shore, then he lifted his voice
      again, giving it as his opinion that he was the only Christian seen in
      those parts in the last fifty years. He offered to fight any gentleman who
      felt disposed to challenge this assertion. He sprang suddenly aloft,
      knocked his bare heels together and uttered an ear-piercing whoop. He
      subsided and gazed off into the red eye of the sun which was slipping back
      of the trees. Presently he spoke again. He offered to lick any gentleman
      who felt aggrieved by his previous remarks, for fifty cents, for a drink
      of whisky, for a chew of tobacco, for nothing&mdash;with one hand tied
      behind him! He sprang aloft, cracked his heels together as before and
      crowed insultingly; then he subsided into silence. An instant later he
      appeared stung by the acutest pangs of remorse. In a cringing tone he
      begged Polly to forgive him for bringing her to such a place. He bewailed
      that they had risked pollution by allowing any inhabitant of that region
      to set foot on the raft&mdash;he feared for the innocent minds of their
      children, and he implored her pardon. Perhaps it was better that they
      should cast off at once&mdash;unless one of the gentlemen on shore felt
      himself insulted, in which event he would remain to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then as he slowly worked the raft out toward the middle of the stream, he
      repeated all his former remarks, punctuating them with frequent whoops. He
      recapitulated the terms on which he could be induced to fight-fifty cents,
      a drink of liquor, a chew of tobacco, nothing! His shouts became fainter
      and fainter as the raft was swept down-stream, and finally died away in
      the distance.

      CHAPTER XIII. THE JUDGE BREAKS JAIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sheriff had brought the judge's supper. He reported that the crowd was
      dispersing, and that on the whole public sentiment was not particularly
      hostile; indeed, he went so far as to say there existed a strong
      undercurrent of satisfaction that the jail should have so speedily
      justified itself. Moreover, there was a disposition to exalt the judge as
      having furnished the crowning touch to the day's pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon, sir, they'd have felt obliged to string you up if there wa'n't
      no jail,&rdquo; continued the sheriff lazily from the open door where he had
      seated himself. &ldquo;I don't say there ain't them who don't maintain you had
      ought to be strung up as it is, but people are funny, sir; the majority
      talk like they might wish to keep you here indefinite. There's no telling
      when we'll get another prisoner. Tomorrow the blacksmith will fix some
      iron bars to your window so folks can look in and see you. It will give a
      heap more air to the place&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I do get more air, you will not be troubled long by me!&rdquo; declared
      the judge in a tone of melancholy conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The building was intolerably hot, the advantages of ventilation having
      been a thing the citizens of Pleasantville had overlooked. But the judge
      was a reasonable soul; he was disposed to accept his immediate personal
      discomfort with a fine true philosophy; also, hope was stirring in his
      heart. Hope was second nature with him, for had he not lived all these
      years with the odds against him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do sweat some, don't you? Oh, well, a man can stand a right smart
      suffering from heat like this and not die. It's the sun that's dangerous,&rdquo;
       remarked the sheriff consolingly. &ldquo;And you had ought to suffer, sir!
      that's what folks are sent to jail for,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will kindly bear in mind, sir, that I have been convicted of no
      crime!&rdquo; retorted the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hadn't been so blamed particular you might have had company;
      politest darky you would meet anywhere. Well, sir, I didn't think the boss
      orator of the day would be the first prisoner&mdash;the joke certainly is
      on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw such bloody-minded ruffians! Keep them out and keep me in&mdash;all
      I ask is to vindicate myself in the eyes of the world,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began the sheriff severely, &ldquo;ain't it enough to make 'em
      bloody-minded? Any one of 'em might have taken your money and got stuck.
      Just to think of that is what hets them up.&rdquo; He regarded the judge with a
      glance of displeasure. &ldquo;I hate to see a man so durn unreasonable in his
      p'int of view. And you picked a lady&mdash;a widow-lady&mdash;say, ain't
      you ashamed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, what's going to happen to me?&rdquo; demanded the judge angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you'll be tried. I reckon the law will deal with you&mdash;that
      is, if the public remains ca'm. Maybe it will come to the conclusion that
      it'd prefer a lynching&mdash;people are funny.&rdquo; He seemed to detach
      himself from the possible current of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, waking and sleeping, I have that before me!&rdquo; cried the judge
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had ought to have thought of that sooner, when you was unloading that
      money. Why, it ain't even good counterfeit! I wonder a man of your years
      wa'n't slicker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you taken steps to find the boy, or Solomon Mahaffy?&rdquo; inquired the
      judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is my innocence going to be established&mdash;how am I going to clear
      myself if my witnesses are hounded out of the county?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love to hear you talk, sir. I told 'em at the raising to-day that I
      considered you one of the most eloquent minds I had ever listened to&mdash;but
      naturally, sir, you are too smart to be honest. You say you ain't been
      convicted yet; but you're going to be! There's quite a scramble for places
      on the jury already. There was pistols drawed up at the tavern by some of
      our best people, sir, who got het up disputin' who was eligible to serve.&rdquo;
       The judge groaned. &ldquo;You should be thankful them pistols wasn't drawed on
      you, sir,&rdquo; said the sheriff amiably. &ldquo;You've got a heap to be grateful
      about; for we've had one lynching, and we've rid one or two parties on a
      rail after giving 'em a coat of tar and feathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge shuddered. The sheriff continued placidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take it you'll get all that's coming to you, sir, say about twenty
      years&mdash;that had ought to let you out easy. Sort of round out your
      earthly career, and leave something due you t'other side of Jordan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is no use in my pointing out to you that I did not know
      the money was counterfeit, and that I was quite innocent of any intention
      to defraud Mrs. Walker?&rdquo; said the judge, with a weary, exasperated air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't make no difference where you got the money; you know that, for
      you set up to be some sort of a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently the sheriff went his way into the dusk of the evening, and night
      came swiftly to fellowship the judge's fears. A single moonbeam found its
      way into the place, making a thin rift in the darkness. The judge sat down
      on the three-legged stool, which, with a shake-down bed, furnished the
      jail. His loneliness was a great wave of misery that engulfed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just so my life ain't cut short!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known a varied career, and what he was pleased to call his
      unparalleled misfortunes had reduced him to all kinds of desperate shifts
      to live, but never before had the law laid its hands on him. True, there
      had been times and seasons when he had been grateful for the gloom of the
      dark ways he trod, for echoes had taken the place of the living voice that
      had once spoken to his soul; but he could still rest his hand upon his
      heart and say that the law had always nodded to him to pass on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where was Solomon Mahaffy, and where Hannibal? He felt that Mahaffy could
      fend for himself, but he experienced a moment of genuine concern when he
      thought of the child. In spite of himself, his thoughts returned to him
      again and again. But surely some one would shelter and care for him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and work him like a horse, and probably abuse him into the
      bargain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a scarcely audible rustle on the margin of the woods, a dry
      branch snapped loudly. A little pause succeeded in which the judge's heart
      stood still. Next a stealthy step sounded in the clearing. The judge had
      an agonized vision of regulators and lynchers. The beat of his pulse
      quickened. He knew something of the boisterous horseplay of the frontier.
      The sheriff had spoken of tar and feathers&mdash;very quietly he stood
      erect and picked up the stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven helping me, I'll brain a citizen or two before it comes to that!&rdquo;
       he told himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cautious steps continued to approach. Some one paused below the
      closely shuttered window, and a hand struck the boards sharply. A whisper
      stole into the jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you awake, Price?&rdquo; It was Mahaffy who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, Solomon Mahaffy!&rdquo; cried the judge unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got the boy&mdash;he's with me,&rdquo; said Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you both!&rdquo; repeated the judge brokenly. &ldquo;Take care of him,
      Solomon. I feel better now, knowing he's in good hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Judge&mdash;&rdquo; it was Hannibal
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm mighty sorry that ten dollars I loaned you was bad&mdash;but you
      don't need ever to pay it back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy gave way to mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; said the judge indulgently. &ldquo;It performed all the essential
      functions of a perfectly legal currency. Just suppose we had discovered it
      was counterfeit before I took it to the tavern&mdash;that would have been
      a hardship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were Captain Murrell gave it to me,&rdquo; explained Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consecrate myself to his destruction! Judge Slocum Price can not be
      humiliated with impunity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you would save your wind, Price, until you'd waddled out
      of danger!&rdquo; Mahaffy spoke, gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you going to get me out of this, Solomon&mdash;for I suppose you
      are here to break jail for me,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy inspected the building. He found that the door was secured by two
      ponderous hasps to which were fitted heavy padlocks, but the solid wooden
      shutter which closed the square hole in the gable that served as a window
      was fastened by a hasp and peg. He withdrew the peg, opened the shutter,
      and the judge's face, wreathed in smiles, appeared at the aperture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blessed sky and air!&rdquo; he murmured, breathing deep. &ldquo;A week of this
      would have broken my spirit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can, Price, you'd better come feet first,&rdquo; suggested Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not sufficiently acrobatic, Solomon&mdash;it's heads or I lose!&rdquo; said the
      judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his shoulders into the opening and wriggled outward. Suddenly
      his forward movement was arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid of that!&rdquo; he said, with a rather piteous smile. &ldquo;It's my
      stomach, Solomon!&rdquo; Mahaffy seized him by the shoulders with lean muscular
      hands. &ldquo;Pull!&rdquo; cried the judge hoarsely. But Mahaffy's vigorous efforts
      failed to move him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you're stuck, Price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get your wind, Solomon,&rdquo; urged the judge, &ldquo;and then, if Hannibal will
      reach up and work about my middle with his knuckles while you pull, I may
      get through.&rdquo; But even this expedient failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you reckon you can get me back? I should not care to spend the night
      so!&rdquo; said the judge. He was purple and panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's try you edgewise!&rdquo; And Mahaffy pushed the judge into the jail
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the judge, after another period of resolute effort on his part
      and on the part of Mahaffy. &ldquo;Providence has been kind to me in the past,
      but it's clear she didn't have me in mind when they cut this hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Price, I guess all we can do is to go back to town and see if I can
      get into my cabin&mdash;I've got an old saw there. If I can find it, I can
      come again to-morrow night and cut away one of the logs, or the cleats of
      the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Heaven's name, do that to-night, Solomon!&rdquo; implored the judge. &ldquo;Why
      procrastinate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price, there's a pack of dogs in this neighborhood, and we must have a
      full night to move in, or they'll pull us down before we've gone ten
      miles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Solomon; I'd forgotten the dogs,&rdquo; and he groaned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy closed and fastened the shutter, then he and Hannibal stole across
      the clearing and entered the woods. The judge flung off his clothes and
      went to bed, determined to sleep away as many hours as possible. He was
      only aroused by the arrival of his breakfast, which the sheriff brought
      about eight o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I was in your boots I couldn't sleep like you!&rdquo; remarked that
      official admiringly. &ldquo;But I reckon, sir, this ain't the first time the
      penitentiary has stared you in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you reckon wrong,&rdquo; said the judge sententiously, as he hauled on his
      trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&mdash;you needn't hurry none. I'll get them dishes when I fetch your
      dinner,&rdquo; he added, as he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later the blacksmith appeared and fitted three iron bars to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that'll hold you, old feller!&rdquo; he observed pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was disposed to linger, since he was interested in the mechanical means
      employed in the making of counterfeit money and thirsted for knowledge at
      first hand. Also, he had in his possession a one-dollar bill which had
      come to him in the way of trade and which local experts had declared to be
      a spurious production. He passed it in between the bars and demanded the
      judge's opinion of it as though he were the first authority in the land.
      But he went no wiser than he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearing the noon hour when the judge's solitude was again invaded.
      He first heard the distant murmur of voices on the road and passed an
      uneasy and restless ten minutes, with his eye to a crack in the door. He
      was soothed and reassured, however, when at last he caught sight of the
      sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, judge, I got company for you,&rdquo; cried the sheriff cheerfully, as he
      threw open the door. &ldquo;A hoss-thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pushed into the building a man, hatless and coatless, with a pair of
      pale villainous eyes and a tobacco-stained chin. The judge viewed the
      new-comer with disfavor. As for the horse-thief, he gave his companion in
      misery a coldly critical stare, seated himself on the stool, and with
      quite a fierce air devoted all his energy to mastication. He neither
      altered his position nor changed his expression until he and the judge
      were alone, then, catching the judge's eye, he made what seemed a casual
      movement with his hand, the three fingers raised; but to the judge this
      clearly was without significance, and the horse-thief manifested no
      further interest where he was concerned. He did not even condescend to
      answer the one or two civil remarks the judge addressed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the long afternoon wore itself away, the judge lived through the many
      stages of doubt and uncertainty, for suppose anything had happened to
      Mahaffy! When the sheriff came with his supper he asked him if he had seen
      or heard of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge, I reckon he's lopin' on yet. I never seen a man of his years run
      as well as he done&mdash;it was inspirin' how he got over the ground!&rdquo;
       answered the sheriff. Then he attempted conversation with the horse-thief,
      but was savagely cursed for his pains. &ldquo;Well, I don't envy you your
      company none, sir,&rdquo; he remarked as he took leave of the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing before the window, the judge watched the last vestige of light
      fade from the sky and the stars appear. Would Mahaffy come? The suspense
      was intolerable. It was possibly eight o'clock. He could not reasonably
      expect Mahaffy until nine or half past; to come earlier would be too great
      a risk. Suddenly out of the silence sounded a long-drawn whistle. Three
      times it was repeated. The horse-thief leaped to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neighbor, that means me!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was rising now, and by its light the judge saw a number of
      horsemen appear on the edge of the woods. They entered the clearing,
      picking their way among the stumps without haste or confusion. When quite
      close, five of the band dismounted; the rest continued on about the jail
      or cantered off toward the road. By this time the judge's teeth were
      chattering and he was dripping cold sweat at every pore. He prayed
      earnestly that they might hang the horsethief and spare him. The
      dismounted men took up a stick of timber that had been cut for the jail
      and not used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out inside, there!&rdquo; cried a voice, and the log was dashed against
      the door; once&mdash;twice&mdash;it rose and fell on the clapboards, and
      under those mighty thuds grew up a wide gap through which the moonlight
      streamed splendidly. The horse-thief stepped between the dangling cleats
      and vanished. The judge, armed with the stool, stood at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What next?&rdquo; a voice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get dry brush&mdash;these are green logs&mdash;we'll burn this jail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; the judge recognized the horse-thief as the speaker. &ldquo;There's
      an old party in there! No need to singe him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I tried him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge tossed away the stool. He understood now that these men were
      neither lynchers nor regulators. With a confident, not to say jaunty step,
      he emerged from the jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your servant, gentlemen!&rdquo; he said, lifting his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git!&rdquo; said one of the men briefly, and the judge moved nimbly away toward
      the woods. He had gained its shelter when the jail began to glow redly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to find Solomon and the boy, and then to put the miles between himself
      and Pleasantville with all diligence. As he thought this, almost at his
      elbow Mahaffy and Hannibal rose from behind a fallen log. The Yankee
      motioned for silence and pointed west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; breathed the judge. He noted that Mahaffy had a heavy pack, and the
      boy his long rifle. For a mile or two they moved forward without speech,
      the boy in the lead; while at his heels strode Mahaffy, with the judge
      bringing up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you feel, Price?&rdquo; asked Mahaffy at length, over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like one come into a fortune! Those horse-thieves gave me a fine scare,
      but did me a good turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal kept to the woods by a kind of instinct, and the two men yielded
      themselves to his guidance; but there was no speech between them. Mahaffy
      trod in the boy's steps, and the judge, puffing like an overworked engine,
      came close upon his heels. In this way they continued to advance for an
      hour or more, then the boy paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; commanded Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you 'low the judge can stand it?&rdquo; asked Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, lad!&rdquo; panted the judge feelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got to stand it&mdash;either that, or what do you suppose will
      happen to us if they start their dogs?&rdquo; said Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon's right&mdash;you are sure we are not going in a circle,
      Hannibal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm sure,&rdquo; said Hannibal. &ldquo;Do you see that star? My Uncle Bob
      learned me how I was to watch that star when I wanted to keep going
      straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another long interval of silence. Bit by bit the sky became
      overcast. Vague, fleecy rifts of clouds appeared in the heavens. A wind
      sprang up, murmuring about them, there came a distant roll of thunder,
      while along the horizon the lightning rushed in broken, jagged lines of
      fire. In the east there was a pale flush that showed the black, hurrying
      clouds the winds had summoned out of space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The booming thunder, first only the sullen menace of the approaching
      storm, rolled nearer and nearer, and the fierce light came in blinding
      sheets of flame. A ceaseless, pauseless murmur sprang up out of the
      distance, and the trees rocked with a mighty crashing of branches, while
      here and there a big drop of rain fell. Then the murmur swelled into a
      roar as the low clouds disgorged themselves. Drenched to the skin on the
      instant, the two men and the boy stumbled forward through the gray wake of
      the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's come of our trail now?&rdquo; shouted the judge, but the sound of his
      voice was lost in the rush of the hurrying winds and the roar of the airy
      cascades that fell about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed. There was light under the trees, faint, impalpable without
      visible cause, but they caught the first sparkle of the rain drops on leaf
      and branch; they saw the silvery rivulets coursing down the mossy trunks
      of old trees; last of all through a narrow rift in the clouds, the sun
      showed them its golden rim, and day broke in the steaming woods. With the
      sun, with a final rush of the hurrying wind, a final torrent, the storm
      spent itself, and there was only the drip from bough and leaf, or pearly
      opalescent points of moisture on the drenched black trunks of maple and
      oak; a sapphire sky, high arched, remote overhead; and the June day all
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's come of they trail now?&rdquo; cried the judge again. &ldquo;He'll be a good
      dog that follows it through, these woods!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had paused on a thickly wooded hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've come eight or ten miles if we have come a rod, Price,&rdquo; said
      Mahaffy, &ldquo;and I am in favor of lying by for the day. When it comes dark we
      can go on again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge readily acquiesced in this, and they presently found a dense
      thicket which they cautiously entered. Reaching the center of the tangled
      growth, they beat down the briers and bushes, or cut them away with their
      knives, until they had a little cleared space where they could build a
      fire. Then from the pack which Mahaffy carried, the rudiments of a simple
      but filling meal were produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your parents took no chances when they named you Solomon!&rdquo; said the judge
      approvingly.

      CHAPTER XIV. BELLE PLAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Tom,&rdquo; said Betty, with a bustling little air of excitement as she
      rose from the breakfast table that first morning at Belle Plain, &ldquo;I am
      ready if you are. I want you to show me everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you'll notice some changes,&rdquo; remarked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went from the room and down the hall a step or two in advance of her.
      On the wide porch Betty paused, breathing deep. The house stood on an
      eminence; directly before it at the bottom of the slight descent was a
      small bayou, beyond this the forest stretched away in one unbroken mass to
      the Mississippi. Here and there, gleaming in the brilliant morning light,
      some great bend of the river was visible through the trees, while the
      Arkansas coast, blue and distant, piled up against the far horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want to see, anyhow, Betty?&rdquo; Tom demanded, turning on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything&mdash;the place, Tom&mdash;Belle Plain! Oh, isn't it
      beautiful! I had no idea how lovely it was!&rdquo; cried Betty, as with her eyes
      still fixed on the distant panorama of woods and water she went down the
      steps, Tom at her heels&mdash;he bet she'd get sick of it all soon enough,
      that was one comfort!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Tom! Why does the lawn look like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; inquired Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this&mdash;all weeds and briers, and the paths overgrown?&rdquo; and as
      Betty surveyed the unkempt waste that had once been a lawn, a little frown
      fixed itself on her smooth brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ware rubbed his chin reflectively with the back of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sort of thing looked all right, Bet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it kept five or
      six of the best hands out of the fields right at the busiest time of the
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I slaves enough?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull color crept into Ware's cheeks. He hated her for that &ldquo;I!&rdquo; So she
      was going to come that on him, was she? And he'd worked himself like a
      horse to bring in more land. Why, he'd doubled the acreage in cotton and
      corn in the last four years! He smothered his sense of hurt and
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you want to see the crops, Bet? Let me order a team and show you
      about, you couldn't walk over the place in a week!&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head and moved swiftly down the path that led from
      terrace to terrace to the margin of the bayou. At the first terrace she
      paused. All below was a wilderness of tangled vines and brush. She faced
      Tom rather piteously. What had been lost was more than he could possibly
      understand. Her father had planned these grounds which he was allowing a
      riotous second growth to swallow up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's positively squalid!&rdquo; cried Betty, with a little stamp of her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ware glanced about with dull eyes. The air of neglect and decay which was
      everywhere visible, and which was such a shock to Betty, had not been
      reached in a season, he was really convinced that the place looked pretty
      much as it had always looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you, Betty, I'm busy this morning; you poke about and see what
      you want done and we'll do it,&rdquo; he said, and made a hasty retreat to his
      office, a little brick building at the other side of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty returned to the porch and seating herself on the top step with her
      elbows on her knees and her chin sunk in the palms of her hands, gazed
      about her miserably enough. She was still seated there when half an hour
      later Charley Norton galloped up the drive from the highroad. Catching
      sight of her on the porch he sprang from the saddle, and, throwing his
      reins to a black boy, hurried to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inspecting your domain, Betty?&rdquo; he asked, as he took his place near her
      on the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me, Charley&mdash;or at least prepare me for this?&rdquo;
       she asked, almost tearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was I to know, Betty? I haven't been here since you went away, dear&mdash;what
      was there to bring me? Old Tom would make a cow pasture out of the Garden
      of Eden, wouldn't he&mdash;a beautiful, practical, sordid soul he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I going to do, Charley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep after him until you get what you want, it's the only way to manage
      Tom that I know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's horrid to have to assert one's self!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to with Tom&mdash;you must, Betty&mdash;he won't understand
      anything else.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;Let's look around and see what's needed, a
      season or two of care will remedy the most of this neglect. Just make Tom
      put a lot of hands in here with brush-hooks and axes and soon you'll not
      know the place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norton spent the day at Belle Plain; and though he was there on his good
      behavior as the result of an agreement they had reached on board The
      Naiad, he proposed twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My intentions are all right, Betty,&rdquo; he assured her in extenuation. &ldquo;But
      I've the worst memory imaginable. Oh, yes, the lower terrace is badly
      gullied, but it's no great matter, it can be fixed with a little work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was soon plain to Betty that Tom's ideals, if he possessed any, had not
      led him in the direction of what he termed display. His social impulse had
      suffered atrophy. The house was utterly disorganized; there was a dearth
      of suitable servants. Those she had known were gone&mdash;sold, she
      learned. Tom explained that there had been no need for them since he had
      lived pretty much in his office, what had been the use in keeping darkies
      standing about doing nothing? He had got rid of those show niggers and put
      their price in husky field hands, who could be made to do a day's work and
      not feel they were abused.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tom was mistaken in his supposition that Betty would soon tire of
      Belle Plain. She demanded men, and teams, and began on the lawns. This
      interested and fascinated her. She was out at sun-up to direct her
      laborers. She had the advantage of Charley Norton's presence and advice
      for the greater part of each day in the week, and Sundays he came to look
      over what had been accomplished, and, as Tom firmly believed, to put that
      little fool up to fresh nonsense. He could have booted him!
    </p>
    <p>
      As the grounds took shape before her delighted eyes, Betty found leisure
      to institute a thorough reformation indoors. A number of house servants
      were rescued from the quarters and she began to instruct them in their new
      duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was sick at heart. The little fool would cripple the place. It gave
      him acute nausea to see the gangs at work about the lawns; it made him
      sicker to pass through the house. There were five or six women in the
      kitchen now&mdash;he was damned if he could see what they found to do&mdash;there
      was a butler and a page. Betty had levied on the stables for one of the
      best teams to draw the family carriage, which had not been in use since
      her mother's death; there was a coachman for that, and another little
      monkey to ride on the rumble and hop down and open gates. This came of
      sending girls away to school&mdash;they only learned foolishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And those niggers about the house had to be dressed for their new work;
      the butler, a cracking plow-hand he was, wore better clothes than he&mdash;Tom&mdash;did.
      No wonder he was sick;&mdash;and waste! Tom knew all about that when the
      bills began to come in from Memphis. Why, that pink-faced chit, he always
      referred to her in his own mind now as a pink-faced chit, was evolving a
      scheme of life that would cost eight or ten thousand dollars a year to
      maintain, and she was talking of decorators for the house, either from New
      Orleans or Philadelphia, and new furniture from top to bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom felt that he was being robbed. Then he realized with a sense of shock
      that here was a fortune of over half a million in lands and slaves which
      he had managed and manipulated all these years, but which was not his. It
      was true that under the terms of his stepmother's will he would inherit it
      in the event of Betty's death&mdash;well, she looked like dying, a whole
      lot&mdash;she was as strong as a mule, those soft rounded curves covered
      plenty of vigorous muscle; Tom hated the very sight of her. A pink-faced
      chit bubbling over with life and useless energy, a perfect curse she was,
      with all sorts of extravagant tastes and he was powerless to check her,
      for, although he was still her guardian, there were certain provisions of
      the will&mdash;he consulted the copy he kept locked up in his desk in the
      office&mdash;that permitted her to do pretty much as she pleased with her
      income. It was a hell of a will! She could spend fifteen or twenty
      thousand dollars a year if she wanted to and he couldn't prevent it. It
      was an iniquitous document!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the place could go straight off to the devil, he wouldn't wear out
      his life economizing for her to waste&mdash;he didn't get a thank-you&mdash;and
      he knew that nobody took off the land bigger crops than he did, while bale
      for bale his cotton outsold all other cotton raised in the county&mdash;that
      was the kind of a manager he was. He wagged his head in self-approval. And
      what did he get out of it? A lump sum each year with a further lump sum of
      twenty thousand dollars when she came of age&mdash;soon now&mdash;or
      married. Tom's eyes bulged from their sockets&mdash;she'd be doing that
      next, to spite him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty's sphere of influence rapidly extended itself. She soon began to
      have her doubts concerning the treatment accorded the slaves, and was not
      long in discovering that Hicks, the overseer, ran things with a heavy
      hand. Matters reached a crisis one day when, happening to ride through the
      quarters, she found him disciplining a refractory black. She turned sick
      at the sight. Here was a slave actually being whipped by another slave
      while Hicks stood looking on with his hands in his pockets, and with a
      brutal satisfied air. When he caught sight of the girl, he sang out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do; he's had enough, I reckon, to learn him!&rdquo; He added sullenly
      to Betty, &ldquo;Sorry you seen this, Miss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you order such a punishment without authority!&rdquo; cried Betty
      furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hicks gave her a black scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't need no authority to whip a shirker,&rdquo; he said insolently, as he
      turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; commanded Betty, her eyes blazing. She strove to keep her voice
      steady. &ldquo;You shall not remain at Belle Plain another hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hicks said nothing. He knew it would take more than her saying so to get
      him off the place. Betty turned her horse and galloped back to the house.
      She felt that she was in no condition to see Tom just at that moment, and
      dismounting at the door ran up-stairs to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the overseer sought out Ware in his office. His manner of stating
      his grievance was singular. He began by swearing at his employer. He had
      been insulted before all the quarter&mdash;his rage fairly choked him, he
      could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom seized the opportunity to swear back. He wanted to know if he hadn't
      troubles enough without the overseer's help? If he'd got himself insulted
      it was his own affair and he could lump it, generally speaking, and get
      out of that office! But Tom's fury quickly spent itself. He wanted to know
      what the matter was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent you off the place, did she; well, you'll have to eat crow. I'll do
      all I can. I don't know what girls were ever made for anyhow, damned if I
      do!&rdquo; he added plaintively, as a realization of a stupendous mistake on the
      part of nature overwhelmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hicks consented to eat crow only after Mr. Ware had cursed and cajoled him
      into a better and more forgiving frame of mind. Then Tom hurried off to
      find Betty and put matters right; a more difficult task than he had
      reckoned on, for Betty was obdurate and her indignation flared up at
      mention of the incident; all his powers of argument and persuasion were
      called into requisition before she would consent to Hicks remaining, and
      then only on that most uncertain tenure, his good behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you come up to the house,&rdquo; said Tom, when he had won his point and
      gone back to Hicks, &ldquo;and get done with it. I reckon you talked when you
      should have kept your blame familiar mouth shut! Come on, and get it over
      with, and say you're sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, after Hicks had made his apology, the two men smoked a friendly
      pipe and discussed the situation. Tom pointed out that opposition was
      useless, a losing game, you could get your way by less direct means. She
      wouldn't stay long at Belle Plain, but while she did remain they must
      avoid any more crises of the sort through which they had just passed, and
      presently; she'd be sick of the place. Tom wagged his head. She was sick
      of it already only she hadn't the sense to know it. It wasn't good enough.
      Nothing suited-the house&mdash;the grounds&mdash;nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of her activities Betty occasionally found time to think of
      Bruce Carrington. She was sure she did not wish to see him again! But when
      three weeks had passed she began to feel incensed that he had not
      appeared. She thought of him with hot cheeks and a quickening beat of the
      heart. It was anger. Naturally she was very indignant, as she had every
      right to be! He was the first man who had dared&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one day when she had decided for ever to banish all memory of him
      from her mind, and never, under any circumstances, to think of him again,
      he presented himself at Belle Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in her room just putting the finishing touches to an especially
      satisfying toilet when her maid tapped on the door and told her there was
      a gentleman in the parlor who wished to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Mr. Norton?&rdquo; asked Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss&mdash;he didn't give no name, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Betty entered the parlor a moment later she saw her caller standing
      with his back turned toward her as he gazed from one of the windows, but
      she instantly recognized those broad shoulders, and the fine poise of the
      shapely head that surmounted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Carrington&mdash;&rdquo; and Betty stopped short, while her face grew
      rather pale and then crimsoned. Then she advanced quite boldly and held
      out a frigid hand, which he took carefully. &ldquo;I didn't know&mdash;so you
      are alive&mdash;you disappeared so suddenly that night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm alive,&rdquo; he said, and then with a smile. &ldquo;But I fear before you
      get through with me we'll both wish I were not, Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't call me Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that man who met you at New Madrid? He can't have you, whoever he
      is!&rdquo; His eyes dwelt on her tenderly, and the remembered spell of her fresh
      youthful beauty deepened itself for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he doesn't want me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he does. That was plain as day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty surveyed him from under her lashes. What could she do with this man?
      Nothing affected him. He seemed to have crossed some intangible barrier
      and to stand closer to her than any other man had ever stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you still hate me, Betty&mdash;Miss Malroy&mdash;is there anything I
      can say or do that will make you forgive me?&rdquo; He looked at her penitently.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Betty hardened her heart against him and prepared to keep him in
      place. Remembering that he was still holding her hand, she recovered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sit down?&rdquo; she indicated a chair. He seated himself and Betty
      put a safe distance between them. &ldquo;Are you staying in the neighborhood,
      Mr. Carrington?&rdquo; she asked, rather unkindly. How did he dare come here
      when she had forgotten him and her annoyance? And now the sight of him
      brought back memories of that disagreeable night on that horrid boat&mdash;he
      had deceived her about that boat, too&mdash;she would never forgive him
      for that&mdash;she had trusted him and he had clearly shown that he was
      not to be trusted; and Betty closed her pretty mouth until it was a thin
      red line and looked away that she might not see his hateful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not staying in the neighborhood. When I left you, I made up my
      mind I'd wait at New Madrid until I could come on down here and say I was
      sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it's taken you all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington regarded her seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I must have come for more time, Betty&mdash;Miss Malroy.&rdquo; In
      spite of herself, Betty glowed under the caressing humor of his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really&mdash;you must have chosen poorly then when you selected New
      Madrid. It couldn't have been a good place for your purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think if I could have made up my mind to stay there long enough, it
      would have answered,&rdquo; said Carrington. &ldquo;But when a down-river boat tied up
      'there yesterday it was more than I could stand. You 'see there's danger
      in a town like New Madrid of getting too sorry. I thought we'd better
      discuss this point&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayn't I show you Belle Plain?&rdquo; asked Betty quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Carrington shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care anything about that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn't come here to see
      Belle Plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly are candid,&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to be honest with you always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me&mdash;but I don't know that I shall particularly like it. Do you
      think it was quite fair to select the boat you did, or was your resolution
      to be always honest formed later?&rdquo; demanded Betty severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with great sweetness of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't advise that boat for speed, only for safety. Betty, doesn't it
      mean anything to you that I love you? I admit that I wish it had been
      twice as slow!&rdquo; he added reflectively, as an afterthought. He looked at
      her steadily, and Betty's dark lashes drooped as the color mounted to her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; she said quickly. She rose from her chair, and Carrington
      followed her example with a lithe movement that bespoke muscles in good
      training. She led the way through the wide hall and out to the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I am going to show you all over the place,&rdquo; she announced resolutely.
      She stood on the top step, looking off into the flaming west where the sun
      rode low in the heavens. &ldquo;Isn't it lovely, Mr. Carrington, isn't it
      beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very beautiful!&rdquo; Carrington's glance was fixed on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't care to see Belle Plain,&rdquo; began Betty, rather indignantly.
      &ldquo;No, I don't, Betty. This is enough for me. I'll come for that some other
      time if you'll be good enough to let me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you expect to remain in the neighborhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've given up the river, and I'm going to get hold of some land&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land?&rdquo; said Betty, with a rising inflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were a river-man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a river-man no longer. I am going to be a planter now. But I'll tell
      you why, and all about it some other day.&rdquo; Then he held out his hand.
      &ldquo;Goodby,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going&mdash;good-by, Mr. Carrington,&rdquo; and Betty's fingers tingled
      with his masterful clasp long after he had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington sauntered slowly down the path to the highroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't ask me to come back&mdash;an oversight,&rdquo; he told himself
      cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just beyond the gates he met that same young fellow he had seen at New
      Madrid. Norton nodded good-naturedly as he passed, and Carrington,
      glancing back, saw that he turned in at Belle Plain. He shrugged his
      shoulders, and went on his way not rejoicing.

      CHAPTER XV. THE SHOOTING-MATCH AT BOGGS'
    </h2>
    <p>
      The judge's faith in the reasonableness of mankind having received a
      staggering blow, there began a somewhat furtive existence for himself, for
      Solomon Mahaffy, and for the boy. They kept to little frequented byways,
      and usually it was the early hours of morning, or the cool of late
      afternoons when they took the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat of silent middays found them lounging beside shady pools, where
      the ripple of fretted waters filled the pauses in their talk. It was then
      that the judge and Mahaffy exchanged views on literature and politics, on
      religion and politics, on the public debt and politics, on canals and
      national roads and more politics. They could and did honestly differ at
      great length and with unflagging energy on these vital topics, especially
      politics, for they were as far apart mentally as they were close together
      morally.

    <p>
      Mahaffy, morose and embittered, regarded the life they were living as an
      unmixed hardship. The judge entered upon it with infinite zest. He
      displayed astonishing adaptability, while he brought all the resources of
      a calm and modest knowledge to bear on the vexed problem of procuring
      sustenance for himself and for his two companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To an old campaigner like me, nothing could be more delightful than this
      holiday, coming as it does on the heels of grinding professional
      activity,&rdquo; he observed to Mahaffy. &ldquo;This is the way our first parents
      lived&mdash;close to nature, in touch with her gracious beneficence! Sir,
      this experience is singularly refreshing after twenty years of slaving at
      the desk. If any man can grasp the possibilities of a likely looking
      truck-patch at a glance, I am that man, and as for getting around in the
      dark and keeping the lay of the land&mdash;well, I suppose it's my
      military training. Jackson always placed the highest value on such data as
      I furnished him. He leaned on me more than any other man, Solomon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard he stood up pretty straight,&rdquo; said Mahaffy affably. The
      judge's abandoned conduct distressed him not a little, but his
      remonstrances had been in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider that when society subjected me to the indignity of arrest, I
      was relieved of all responsibility. Injustice must bear its own fruit,&rdquo;
       the judge had answered him sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His beginnings had been modest enough: a few ears of corn, a few hills of
      potatoes, and the like, had satisfied him; then one night he appeared in
      camp with two streaks of scarlet down the side of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt, Price?&rdquo; demanded Mahaffy, betraying an anxiety of which he
      was instantly ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me relieve your apprehension, Solomon; it's only a trickle of stewed
      fruit. I folded a couple of pies and put them in the crown of my hat,&rdquo;
       explained the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you've been in somebody's springhouse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was unlocked, Solomon, This will be a warning to the owner. I consider
      I have done him a kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus launched on a career of plunder, the judge very speedily accumulated
      a water bucket&mdash;useful when one wished to milk a cow&mdash;an ax from
      a woodpile, a kettle from a summer kitchen, a tin of soft soap, and an
      excellent blanket from a wash-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the boy, Solomon,&rdquo; he said gently, when he caught Mahaffy's steady
      disapproving glance fixed upon him as he displayed this last trophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of an example are you setting him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is full of examples I'd not recommend, Solomon. One must learn
      to discriminate. A body can no more follow all the examples than he can
      follow all the roads, and I submit that the ends of morality can as well
      be served in showing a child what he should not do as in showing him what
      he should. Indeed, I don't know but it's the finer educational idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter the judge went through the land with an eye out for wash-lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm looking for a change of linen for the boy, Solomon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let me
      bring you a garment or two. Eh&mdash;how few men you'll find of my build;
      those last shirts I got were tight around the armholes and had no more
      tail than a rabbit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two nights later Mr. Mahaffy accepted a complete change of under linen,
      but without visible sign of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      A night later the judge disappeared from camp, and after a prolonged
      absence returned puffing and panting with three watermelons, which proved
      to be green, since his activity had been much in advance of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose there is any greater tax on human ingenuity than to carry
      three watermelons!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;The human structure is ideally adapted
      to the transportation of two&mdash;it can be done with comfort; but when a
      body tackles three he finds that nature herself is opposed to the
      proceeding! Well, I am going back for a bee-gum I saw in a fence corner.
      Hannibal will enjoy that&mdash;a child is always wanting sweets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this fashion they fared gaily across the state, but as they neared the
      Mississippi the judge began to consider the future. His bright and
      illuminating intelligence dealt with this problem in all its
      many-sidedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd enter one of the learned professions, Solomon&mdash;have you
      ever thought of medicine?&rdquo; he inquired. Mr. Mahaffy laughed. &ldquo;But why not,
      Solomon? There is nothing like a degree or a title&mdash;that always
      stamps a man, gives him standing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I know about the human system?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should certainly hope you know as much as the average doctor knows. We
      could locate in one of these new towns where they have the river on one
      side and the canal on the other, and where everybody has the ague&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I know about medicine?&rdquo; inquired Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as Aesculapius, no doubt&mdash;even he had to make a beginning.
      The torch of science wasn't lit in a day&mdash;you must be willing to
      wait; but you've got a good sick-room manner. Have you ever thought of
      opening an undertaker's shop? If you couldn't cure them you might bury
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A certain hot afternoon brought them into the shaded main street of a
      straggling village. Near the door of the principal building, a frame
      tavern, a man was seated, with his feet on the horse-rack. There was no
      other sign of human occupancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, sir?&rdquo; said the judge, halting before this solitary
      individual whom he conjectured to be the 'landlord. The man nodded,
      thrusting his thumbs into the armholes of his vest. &ldquo;What's the name of
      this bustling metropolis?&rdquo; continued the judge, cocking his head on one
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Bruce Carrington appeared in the tavern door; pausing there,
      he glanced curiously at the shabby wayfarers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Raleigh, in Shelby County, Tennessee, one of the states of the
      Union of which, no doubt, you've heard rumor in your wanderings,&rdquo; said the
      landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the voice from the tomb?&rdquo; inquired the judge, in a tone of
      playful sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington, amused, sauntered toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's one for you, Mr. Pegloe!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am charmed to meet a gentleman whose spirit of appreciation shows his
      familiarity with a literary allusion,&rdquo; said the judge, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain't so dead as we look,&rdquo; said Pegloe. &ldquo;Just you keep on to Boggs'
      race-track, straight down the road, and you'll find that out&mdash;everybody's
      there to the hoss-racing and shooting-match. I reckon you've missed the
      hoss-racing, but you'll be in time for the shooting. Why ain't you there,
      Mr. Carrington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going now, Mr. Pegloe,&rdquo; answered Carrington, as he followed the
      judge, who, with Mahaffy and the boy, had moved off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better stop at Boggs'!&rdquo; Pegloe called after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the judge had already formed his decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horse-racing and shooting-matches were suggestive of that progressive
      spirit, the absence of which he had so much lamented at the jail raising
      at Pleasantville&mdash;Memphis was their objective point, but Boggs'
      became a side issue of importance. They had gained the edge of the village
      when Carrington overtook them. He stepped to Hannibal's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, let me carry that long rifle, son!&rdquo; he said. Hannibal looked up
      into his face, and yielded the piece without a word. Carrington balanced
      it on his big, muscular palm. &ldquo;I reckon it can shoot&mdash;these old guns
      are hard to beat!&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's the clostest shooting rifle I ever sighted,&rdquo; said Hannibal
      promptly. &ldquo;You had ought to see the judge shoot her&mdash;my! he never
      misses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The clostest shooting rifle you ever sighted&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he repeated.
      &ldquo;Why, aren't you afraid of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hannibal scornfully. &ldquo;But she kicks you some if you don't hold
      her right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a rusty name-plate on the stock of the old sporting rifle; this
      had caught Carrington's eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the name here? Oh, Turberville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge, a step or two in advance, wheeled in his tracks with a
      startling suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he faltered, and his face was ashen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I was reading the name here; it is yours; sir, I suppose?&rdquo; said
      Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color crept slowly back into the judge's cheeks, but a tremulous hand
      stole up to his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir&mdash;no; my name is Price&mdash;Slocum Price! Turberville&mdash;Turberville&mdash;&rdquo;
       he muttered thickly, staring stupidly at Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not a common name; you seem to have heard it before?&rdquo; said the
      latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spasm of pain passed over the judge's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I've heard it. The name is on the rifle, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here on the stock, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge took the gun and examined it in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get this rifle, Hannibal?&rdquo; he at length asked brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fetched it away from the Barony, sir; Mr. Crenshaw said I might have
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge gave a great start, and a hoarse inarticulate murmur stole from
      between his twitching lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Barony&mdash;the Barony&mdash;what Barony? The Quintard seat in North
      Carolina, is that what you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge, as though stunned, stared at Hannibal and stared at the rifle,
      where the rusted name-plate danced before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know of the Barony, Hannibal?&rdquo; the words came slowly from the
      judge's lips, and his face had gone gray again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lived at the Barony once, until Uncle Bob took me to Scratch Hill to be
      with him. It were Mr. Crenshaw said I was to have the old sp'otin' rifle,&rdquo;
       said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you lived at the Barony?&rdquo; repeated the judge, and a dull stupid
      wonder struck through his tone, he passed a shaking hand before his eyes.
      &ldquo;How long ago&mdash;when?&rdquo; he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how long it were, but until Uncle Bob carried me away after
      the old general died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge slipped a hand under the child's chin and tilted his face back
      so that he might look into it. For a long moment he studied closely those
      small features, then with a shake of the head he handed the rifle to
      Carrington, and without a word strode forward. Carrington had been
      regarding Hannibal with a quickened interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said, as the judge moved off. &ldquo;You're the boy I saw at Scratch
      Hill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal gave him a frightened glance, and edged to Mr. Mahaffy's side,
      but did not answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's become of Bob Yancy?&rdquo; Carrington went on. He looked from Mahaffy
      to the judge; externally neither of these gentlemen was calculated to
      inspire confidence. Mahaffy, keenly alive to this fact, returned
      Carrington's glance with a fixed and hostile stare. &ldquo;Come&mdash;&rdquo; said
      Carrington good-naturedly, &ldquo;you surely remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I reckon I do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you tell me about Mr. Yancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir; I don't know exactly where he is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you get here?&rdquo; persisted Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mahaffy turned on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see he's with us?&rdquo; he said truculently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear sir, I certainly intended no offense!&rdquo; rejoined Carrington
      rather hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy was plainly disturbed, the debased currency of his affection was
      in circulation where Hannibal was concerned, and he eyed the river-man
      askance. He was prepared to give him the lie should he set up any claim to
      the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge plodded forward, his shoulders drooped, and his head bowed. For
      once silence had fixed its seal upon his lips, no inspiring speech fell
      from them. He had been suddenly swept back into a past he had striven
      these twenty years and more to forget, and his memories shaped themselves
      fantastically. Surely if ever a man had quitted the world that knew him,
      he was that man! He had died and yet he lived&mdash;lived horribly,
      without soul or heart, the empty shell of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      A turn in the road brought them within sight of Boggs' racetrack, a wide
      level meadow. The judge paused irresolutely, and turned his bleared face
      on his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll stop here, Solomon,&rdquo; he said rather wearily, for the spirit of
      boast and jest was quite gone out of him. He glanced toward Carrington.
      &ldquo;Are you a resident of these parts, sir?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been in Raleigh three days altogether,&rdquo; answered Carrington, falling
      into step at his side, and they continued on across the meadow in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you observe the decorations of those refreshment booths?&mdash;the
      tasteful disposition of our national colors, sir?&rdquo; the judge presently
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington smiled; he was able to follow his companion's train of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were elbowing the crowd now. Here were men from the small clearings
      in homespun and butternut or fringed hunting-shirts, with their women folk
      trailing after them. Here, too, in lesser numbers, were the lords of the
      soil, the men who counted their acres by the thousand and their slaves by
      the score. There was the flutter of skirts among the moving groups, the
      nodding of gay parasols that shaded fresh young faces, while occasionally
      a comfortable family carriage with some planter's wife or daughter rolled
      silently over the turf; for Boggs' race-track was a famous meeting-place
      where families that saw one another not above once or twice a year,
      friends who lived a day's hard drive apart even when summer roads were at
      their best, came as to a common center.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge's dull eye kindled, the haggard lines that had streaked his face
      erased themselves. This was life, opulent and full. These swift rolling
      carriages with their handsome women, these well-dressed men on foot, and
      splendidly mounted, all did their part toward lifting him out of his
      gloom. He settled his hat on his head with a rakish slant and his walk
      became a strut, he courted observation; he would have been grateful for a
      word, even a jest at his expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry from Hannibal drew his attention. Turning, he was in time to see the
      boy bound away. An instant later, to his astonishment, he saw a young girl
      who was seated with two men in an open carriage, spring to the ground, and
      dropping to her knees put her arms about the tattered little figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hannibal!&rdquo; cried Betty Malroy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Betty! Miss Betty!&rdquo; and Hannibal buried his head on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Hannibal; what is it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, only I'm so glad to find you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see you, too!&rdquo; said Betty, as she wiped his tears away.
      &ldquo;When did you get here, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got here just to-day, Miss Betty,&rdquo; said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ware, careless as to dress, with a wiry black beard of a week's growth
      decorating his chin and giving an unkempt appearance which his expression
      did not mitigate, it being of the sour and fretful sort; scowled down on
      the child. He had favored Boggs' with his presence, not because he felt
      the least interest in horse-racing, but because he had no faith in girls,
      and especially had he profound mistrust of Betty. She was so much easily
      portable wealth, a pink-faced chit ready to fall into the arms of the
      first man who proposed to her. But Charley Norton had not seemed disturbed
      by the planter's forbidding air. Between those two there existed complete
      reciprocity of feeling, inasmuch as Tom's presence was as distasteful to
      Norton as his own presence was distressing to Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your Uncle Bob, Hannibal?&rdquo; Betty asked, glancing about, and at
      her question a shadow crossed the child's face and the tears gathered
      again in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't you seen him, Miss Betty?&rdquo; he whispered. He had been sustained by
      the belief that when he found her he should find his Uncle Bob, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you mean, Hannibal&mdash;isn't your Uncle Bob with you?&rdquo;
       demanded Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got hurt in a fight, and I got separated from him way back yonder just
      after we came out of the mountains.&rdquo; He looked up piteously into Betty's
      face. &ldquo;But you think he'll find me, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you poor little thing!&rdquo; cried Betty compassionately, and again she
      sank on her knees at Hannibal's side, and slipped her arms about him. The
      child began to cry softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ragamuffin's this, Betty?&rdquo; growled Ware disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Betty did not seem to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come alone, Hannibal?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; the judge and Mr. Mahaffy, they fetched me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge had drawn nearer as Betty and Hannibal spoke together, but
      Mahaffy hung back. There were gulfs not to be crossed by him. It was
      different with the judge; the native magnificence of his mind fitted him
      for any occasion. He pulled up his stock, and coaxed a half-inch of limp
      linen down about his wrists, then very splendidly he lifted his napless
      hat from his shiny bald head and pressing it against his fat chest with
      much fervor, elegantly inclined himself from the hips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me the honor to present myself, ma'am&mdash;Price is my name&mdash;Judge
      Slocum Price. May I be permitted to assume that this is the Miss Betty of
      whom my young protege so often speaks?&rdquo; The judge beamed benevolently, and
      rested a ponderous hand on the boy's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Ware gave him a glance of undisguised astonishment, while Norton
      regarded him with an expression of stunned and resolute gravity. Mahaffy
      seemed to be undergoing a terrible moment of uncertainty. He was divided
      between two purposes: one was to seize Price by the coat tails and drag
      him back into the crowd; the other was to kick him, and himself fly that
      spot. This singular impulse sprang from the fact that he firmly believed
      his friend's appearance was sufficient to blast the boy's chances in every
      quarter; nor did he think any better of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty looked at the judge rather inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad he has found friends,&rdquo; she said slowly. She wanted to believe
      that judge Slocum Price was somehow better than he looked, which should
      have been easy, since it was incredible that he could have been worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has indeed found friends,&rdquo; said the judge with mellow unction, and
      swelling visibly. These prosperous appearing people should be of use to
      him, God willing&mdash;he made a sweeping gesture. &ldquo;I have assumed the
      responsibility of his future&mdash;he is my care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Betty caught sight of Carrington and bowed. Occupied with Hannibal and
      the judge, she had been unaware of his presence. Carrington stepped
      forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you met Mr. Norton, and my brother, Mr. Carrington?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men shook hands, and Ware improved the opportunity to
      inspect the new-comer. But as his glance wandered over him, it took in
      more than Carrington, for it included the fine figure and swarthy face of
      Captain Murrell, who, with his eyes fixed on Betty, was thrusting his
      eager way through the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murrell had presented himself at Belle Plain the day before. For upward of
      a year, Ware had enjoyed great peace of mind as a direct result of his
      absence from west Tennessee, and when he thought of him at all he had
      invariably put a period to his meditations with, &ldquo;I hope to hell he
      catches it wherever he is!&rdquo; It had really seemed a pernicious thing to him
      that no one had shown sufficient public spirit to knock the captain on the
      head, and that this had not been done, utterly destroyed his faith in the
      good intentions of Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than this, Betty had spoken of the captain in no uncertain terms. He
      was not to repeat that visit. Tom must make that point clear to him. Tom
      might entertain him if he liked at his office, but the doors of Belle
      Plain were closed against Captain Murrell; he was not to set his foot
      inside of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Murrell approached, the hot color surged into Betty's face. As for
      Hannibal, he had gone white to the lips, and his small hand clutched hers
      desperately; he was remembering all the terror of that hot dawn at
      Slosson's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murrell, with all his hardihood, realized that a too great confidence had
      placed him in an awkward position, for Betty turned her back on him and
      began an animated conversation with Carrington and Charley Norton; only
      Hannibal and the judge continued to regard him; the boy with a frightened,
      fascinated stare, the judge with a wide sweet smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hicks, the Belle Plain overseer, pushed his way to Murrell's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, John Murrell, ain't you going to show us a trick or two?&rdquo; he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murrell turned quickly with a sense of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can spare me your rifle,&rdquo; he said, but his face wore a bleak look.
      Glancing at Betty, he took up his station with the other contestants,
      whereupon two or three young planters silently withdrew from the
      firing-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think you've seen about enough, Bet?&rdquo; demanded Tom. &ldquo;You don't
      care for the shooting, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the very thing I do care for; I think I'd rather see that than the
      horse-racing,&rdquo; said Betty perversely. This had been her first appearance
      in public since her home-coming, and she felt that it had been most
      satisfactory. She had met everybody she had ever known, and scores of new
      people; her progress had been quite triumphal in spite of Tom, and in
      spite of Charley Norton, who was plainly not anxious to share her with any
      one, his devotion being rather of the monopolizing sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty now seated herself in the carriage, with Hannibal beside her,
      quietly determined to miss nothing. The judge, feeling that he had come
      into his own, leaned elegantly against the wheel, and explained the merits
      of each shot as it was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our intruding friend, the Captain, ma'am, is certainly a master with his
      weapon,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty was already aware of this. She turned to Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley, I can't bear to have him win!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid he will, for anything I can do, Betty,&rdquo; said Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carrington, can't you shoot?&mdash;do take Hannibal's rifle and beat
      him,&rdquo; she coaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be too sure that I can!&rdquo; said Carrington, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know you can!&rdquo; urged Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you gentlemen are not going to let me walk off with the prize?&rdquo;
       said Murrell, approaching the group about the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Norton, I am told you are clever with the rifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not shooting to-day,&rdquo; responded Norton haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murrell stalked back to the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At forty paces I'd risk it myself, ma'am,&rdquo; said the judge. &ldquo;But at a
      hundred, offhand like this, I should most certainly fail&mdash;I've burnt
      too much midnight oil. Eh&mdash;what&mdash;damn the dog, he's scored
      another center shot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be hard to beat that&mdash;&rdquo; they heard Murrell say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least it would be quite possible to equal it,&rdquo; said Carrington,
      advancing with Hannibal's rifle in his hands. It was tossed to his
      shoulder, and poured out its contents in a bright stream of flame. There
      was a moment of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Center shot, ma'am!&rdquo; cried the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll add twenty dollars to the purse!&rdquo; Norton addressed himself to
      Carrington. &ldquo;And I shall hope, sir, to see it go in to your pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our sentiments exactly, ma'am, are they not?&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you'd like to bet a little of your money?&rdquo; remarked Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm ready to do that too, sir,&rdquo; responded Norton quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred dollars, then, that this gentleman in whose success you take
      so great an interest, can neither equal nor better my next shot!&rdquo; Murrell
      had produced a roll of bills as he spoke. Norton colored with
      embarrassment. Carrington took in the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute&mdash;&rdquo; he said, and passed his purse to Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cover his money, sir,&rdquo; he added briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my horses have run away with most of my cash,&rdquo; explained
      Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your shot!&rdquo; said Carrington shortly, to the outlaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murrell taking careful aim, fired, clipping the center.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the result was known, Carrington raised his rifle; his bullet,
      truer than his opponent's, drove out the center. Murrell turned on him
      with an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shoot well, but a board stuck against a tree is no test for a man's
      nerve,&rdquo; he said insolently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington was charging his piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know of one other kind of target,&rdquo; he observed coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a living target!&rdquo; cried Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd opened from right to left. Betty's face grew white, and uttering
      a smothered cry she started to descend from the carriage, but the judge
      rested his hand on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear young, lady, our friend is quite able to care for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington shook the priming into the pan of Hannibal's ancient weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready for that, too,&rdquo; he said. There was a slow smile on his lips,
      but his eyes, black and burning, looked the captain through and through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time&mdash;&rdquo; said Murrell, scowling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any time,&rdquo; answered Carrington indifferently.

      CHAPTER XVI. THE PORTAL OF HOPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This&mdash;&rdquo; the speaker was judge Price; &ldquo;this is the place for me: They
      are a warm-hearted people, sir; a prosperous people, and a patriotic
      people with an unstinted love of country. A people full of rugged virtues
      engaged in carving a great state out of the indulgent bosom of Nature. I
      like the size of their whisky glasses; I like the stuff that goes into
      them; I despise a section that separates its gallons into too many
      glasses. Show me a community that does that, and I'll show you a community
      rapidly tending toward a low scale of living. I'd like to hang out my
      shingle here and practise law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge and Mr. Mahaffy were camped in the woods between Boggs' and
      Raleigh. Betty had carried Hannibal off to spend the night at Belle Plain,
      Carrington had disappeared with Charley Norton; but the judge and Mahaffy
      had lingered in the meadow until the last refreshment booth struck its
      colors to the twilight, and they had not lingered in vain. The judge threw
      himself at full length on the ground, and Mahaffy dropped at his side.
      About them, in the ruddy glow of their camp-fire, rose the dark wall of
      the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave opportunity, Solomon&mdash;the indorsement of my own class. I
      feel that I shall have it here,&rdquo; resumed the judge pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mahaffy was sad in his joy, sober in his incipientent drunkenness. The
      same handsome treatment which the judge commended, had been as freely
      tendered him, yet he saw the end of all such hospitality. This was the
      worm in the bud. The judge, however, was an eager idealist; he still
      dreamed of Utopia, he still believed in millenniums. Mahaffy didn't and
      couldn't. Memory was the scarecrow in the garden of his hopes&mdash;you
      could wear out your welcome anywhere. In the end the world reckoned your
      cost, and unless you were prepared to make some sort of return for its
      bounty, the cold shoulder came to be your portion instead of the warm
      handclasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannibal has found friends among people of the first importance. I have
      made it my business to inquire into their standing, and I find that young
      lady is heiress to a cool half million. Think of that, Solomon&mdash;think
      of that! I never saw anything more beautiful than her manifestation of
      regard for my protege&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you made it your business, Mr. Price, to do your very damnedest to
      ruin his chances,&rdquo; said Mahaffy, with sudden heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ruin his chances?&mdash;I, sir? I consider that I helped his chances
      immeasurably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then, you helped his chances&mdash;only you didn't, Price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to understand, Solomon, that you regard my interest in the boy as
      harmful?&rdquo; inquired the judge, in a tone of shocked surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regard it as a calamity,&rdquo; said Mahaffy, with cruel candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about you, Solomon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Equally a calamity. Mr. Price, you don't seem able to grasp just what we
      look like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mind's the only measure of the man, Solomon. If anybody can talk to
      me and be unaware that they are conversing with a gentleman, all I can say
      is their experience has been as pitiable as their intelligence is meager.
      But it hurts me when you intimate that I stand in the way of the boy's
      opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price, what do you; suppose we look like&mdash;you and I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a general way, Solomon, I am conscious that our appeal is to the brain
      rather than the eye,&rdquo; answered the judge, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon even you couldn't do a much lower trick than use the boy as a
      stepping-stone,&rdquo; pursued Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you have the heart to charge me with such a purpose&mdash;I
      don't indeed, Solomon.&rdquo; The judge spoke with deep feeling; he was really
      hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you let the boy have his chance, and don't you stick in your broken
      oar,&rdquo; cried Mahaffy fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge rolled over on his back, and stared up at the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a new aspect of your versatile nature, Solomon. Must I regard you
      as a personally emancipated moral influence, not committed to the straight
      and narrow path yourself, but still close enough to it to keep my feet
      from straying?&rdquo; he at length demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy having spoken his mind, preserved a stony silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge got up and replenished the camp-fire, which had burnt low, then
      squatting before it, he peered into the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll not deny, Solomon, that Miss Malroy exhibited a real affection for
      Hannibal?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't you try to borrow money of her, Price,&rdquo; said Mahaffy, returning
      to the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon&mdash;Solomon&mdash;how can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll be your next move. Now let her alone; let Hannibal have his luck
      as it comes to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to forget, sir, that I still bear the name of gentleman!&rdquo; said
      the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy gave way to acid merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, see that you are not tempted to forget that,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I didn't know your sterling qualities, Solomon, and pay homage to 'em,
      I might be tempted to take offense,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's like pouring water on a duck's back to talk to you, Price; nothing
      strikes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I am at all times ready to listen to reason from any
      quarter, but I've studied this matter in its many-sided aspect. I won't
      say we might not do better in Memphis, but we must consider the boy. No;
      if I can find a vacant house in Raleigh, I wouldn't ask a finer spot in
      which to spend the afternoon of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afternoon?&rdquo; snapped Mahaffy irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right&mdash;carp&mdash;! But you can't relegate me! You can't
      shove me away from the portal of hope&mdash;metaphorically speaking, I'm
      on the stoop; it may be God's pleasure that I enter; there's a place for
      gray heads&mdash;and there's a respectable slice of life after the
      meridian is passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've made my impression; I've been thrown with cultivated minds quick to
      recognize superiority; I've met with deference and consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you forgetting the boy?&rdquo; inquired Mahaffy. &ldquo;No, sir! I regard my
      obligations where he is concerned as a sacred trust to be administered in
      a lofty and impersonal manner. If his friends&mdash;if Miss Malroy, for
      instance&mdash;cares to make me the instrument of her benefactions, I'll
      not be disposed to stand on my dignity; but his education shall be my
      care. I'll make such a lawyer of him as America has not seen before! I
      don't ask you to accept my own opinion of my fitness to do this, but two
      gentlemen with whom I talked this evening&mdash;one of them was the
      justice of the peace&mdash;were pleased to say that they had never heard
      such illuminating comments on the criminal law. I quoted the Greeks and
      Romans to 'em, sir; I gave 'em the salient points on mediaeval law; and
      they were dumfounded and speechless. I reckon they'd never heard such an
      exposition of fundamental principles; I showed 'em the germ and I showed
      'em fruition. Damn it, sir, they were overwhelmed by the array of facts I
      marshaled for 'em. They said they'd never met with such erudition&mdash;no
      more they had, for I boiled down thirty years of study into ten minutes of
      talk! I flogged 'em with facts, and then we drank&mdash;&rdquo; The judge
      smacked his lips. &ldquo;It is this free-handed hospitality I like; it's this
      that gives life its gala aspect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He forgot former experiences; but without this kindly refusal of memory to
      perform its wonted functions, the world would have been a chill place
      indeed for Slocum Price. But Mahaffy, keen and anxious, with doubt in
      every glass he drained, a lurking devil to grin at him above the rim,
      could see only the end of their brief hour of welcome. This made the
      present moment as bitter as the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a theory, Solomon, that I shall be handsomely supported by my new
      friends. They'll snatch at the opportunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see 'em snatching, Mr. Price,&rdquo; said Mahaffy grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right&mdash;go on and plant doubt in my heart if you can! You're
      as hopeless as the grave side!&rdquo; cried the judge, a spasm of rage shaking
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing for us to do&mdash;you and I, Price&mdash;is to clear out of
      here,&rdquo; said Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what of the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him with his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know Miss Malroy would be willing to assume his care? It's
      scandalous the way you leap at conclusions. No, Solomon, no&mdash;I won't
      shirk a single irksome responsibility,&rdquo; and the judge's voice shook with
      suppressed emotion. Mahaffy laughed. &ldquo;There you go again, Solomon, with
      that indecent mirth of yours! Friendship aside, you grow more offensive
      every day.&rdquo; The judge paused and then resumed. &ldquo;I understand there's a
      federal judgeship vacant here. The president&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Mahaffy gave him
      a furtive leer. &ldquo;I tell you General Jackson was my friend&mdash;we were
      brothers, sir&mdash;I stood at his side on the glorious blood-wet field of
      New Orleans! You don't believe me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price, you've made more demands on my stock of credulity than any man
      I've ever known!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge became somber-faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unparalleled misfortune overtook me&mdash;I stepped aside, but the world
      never waits; I was a cog discarded from the mechanism of society&mdash;&rdquo;
       He was so pleased with the metaphor that he repeated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Price, you talk as though you were a modern job; what's the
      matter anyhow?&mdash;have you got boils?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge froze into stony silence. Well, Mahaffy could sneer&mdash;he
      would show him! This was the last ditch and he proposed to descend into
      it, it was something to be able to demand the final word of fate&mdash;but
      he instantly recalled that he had been playing at hide-and-seek with
      inevitable consequences for something like a quarter of a century; it had
      been a triumph merely to exist. Mahaffy having eased his conscience,
      rolled over and promptly went to sleep. Flat on his back, the judge stared
      up at the wide blue arch of the heavens and rehearsed those promises which
      in the last twenty years he had made and broken times without number. He
      planned no sweeping reforms, his system of morality being little more than
      a series of graceful compromises with himself. He must not get hopelessly
      in debt; he must not get helplessly drunk. Dealing candidly with his own
      soul in the silence, he presently came to the belief that this might be
      done without special hardship. Then suddenly the rusted name-plate on
      Hannibal's old rifle danced again before his burning eyes, and a bitter
      sense of hurt and loss struck through him. He saw himself as he was, a
      shabby outcast, a tavern hanger-on, the utter travesty of all he should
      have been; he dropped his arm across his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first rift of light in the sky found the judge stirring; it found him
      in his usual cheerful frame of mind. He disposed of his toilet and
      breakfast with the greatest expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you stroll into town with me, Solomon?&rdquo; he asked, when they had
      eaten. Mahaffy shook his head, his air was still plainly hostile. &ldquo;Then
      let your prayers follow me, for I'm off!&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes' walk brought him to the door of the city tavern, where he
      found Mr. Pegloe directing the activities of a small colored boy who was
      mopping out his bar. To him the judge made known his needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin' to locate, are you?&rdquo; said Mr. Pegloe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends urge it, sir, and I have taken the matter under
      consideration,&rdquo; answered the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho, do you know any folks hereabouts?&rdquo; asked Mr. Pegloe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; said the judge, with reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the only empty house in town is right over yonder; it belongs to
      young Charley Norton out at Thicket Point Plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house Mr. Pegloe had pointed out was a small frame building; it stood
      directly on the street, with a narrow porch across the front, and a shed
      addition at the back. The judge scuttled over to it. With his hands
      clasped under the tails of his coat he walked twice about the building,
      stopping to peer in at all the windows, then he paused and took stock of
      his surroundings. Over the way was Pegloe's City Tavern; farther up the
      street was the court-house, a square wooden box with a crib that housed a
      cracked bell, rising from a gable end. The judge's pulse quickened. What a
      location, and what a fortunate chance that Mr. Norton was the owner of
      this most desirable tenement.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must see him at once. As he turned away to recross the street and learn
      from Mr. Pegloe by what road Thicket Point might be reached, Norton
      himself galloped into the village. Catching sight of the judge, he reined
      in his horse and swung himself from the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hoping, sir, I might find you,&rdquo; he said, as they met before the
      tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wish I should have echoed had I been aware of it!&rdquo; responded the judge.
      &ldquo;I was about to do myself the honor to wait upon you at your plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have saved you a long walk,&rdquo; said Norton. He surveyed the judge
      rather dubiously, but listened with great civility and kindness as he
      explained the business that would have taken him to Thicket Point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is quite at your service, sir,&rdquo; he said, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rent&mdash;&rdquo; began the judge. He had great natural delicacy always in
      mentioning matters of a financial nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Norton, with a delicacy equal to his own, entreated him not to
      mention the rent. The house had come to him as boot in a trade. It had
      been occupied by a doctor and a lawyer; these gentlemen had each decamped
      between two days, heavily in debt at the stores and taverns, especially
      the taverns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't honestly say they owed me, since I never expected to get anything
      out of them; however, they both left some furniture, all that was
      necessary for the kind of housekeeping they did, for they were single
      gentlemen and drew the bulk of their nourishment from Pegloe's bar. I'll
      turn the establishment over to you with the greatest pleasure in the
      world, and wish you better luck than your predecessors had&mdash;you'll
      offend me if you refer to the rent again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus handsomely did Charley Norton acquit himself of the mission he
      had undertaken at Betty Malroy's request.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same morning Tom Ware and Captain Murrell were seated in the small
      detached building at Belle Plain, known as the office, where the former
      spent most of his time when not in the saddle. Whatever the planter's
      vices, and he was reputed to possess a fair working knowledge of good and
      evil, no one had ever charged him with hypocrisy. His emotions lay close
      to the surface and wrote themselves on his unprepossessing exterior with
      an impartial touch. He had felt no pleasure when Murrell rode into the
      yard, and he had welcomed him according to the dictates of his mood, which
      was one of surly reticence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your sister doesn't like me, Tom&mdash;that's on your mind this
      morning, is it?&rdquo; Murrell was saying, as he watched his friend out of the
      corner of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was mad enough, the way you pushed in on us at Boggs' yesterday. What
      happened back in North Carolina, Murrell, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind what happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's none of my business, I reckon; she'll have to look out for
      herself, she's nothing to me but a pest sand a nuisance&mdash;I've been
      more bothered since she came back than I've been in years! I'd give a good
      deal to be rid of her,&rdquo; said Ware, greatly depressed as he recalled the
      extraordinary demands Betty had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it worth my while and I'll take her off your hands,&rdquo; and Murrell
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom favored him with a sullen stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better get rid of that notion&mdash;of all fool nonsense, this love
      business is the worst! I can't see the slightest damn difference between
      one good looking girl and another. I wish every one was as sensible as I
      am,&rdquo; he lamented. &ldquo;I wouldn't miss a meal, or ten minutes' sleep, on
      account of any woman in creation,&rdquo; and Ware shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your sister doesn't like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she doesn't,&rdquo; said Ware, with simple candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you to put a stop to my coming here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here&mdash;to the house, yes. She doesn't give a damn, so long as she
      doesn't have to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murrell, somber-faced and thoughtful, examined a crack in the flooring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to know what happened back yonder in North Carolina to make her
      so blazing mad?&rdquo; continued Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you want to know, I told her I loved her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, that's the fool talk girls like to hear,&rdquo; said Ware. He
      lighted a cigar with an air of wearied patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door, Tom,&rdquo; commanded Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is close in here,&rdquo; agreed the planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that, but you smoke the meanest cigars I ever smelt, I always
      think your shoes are on fire. Tom, do you want to get rid of her? Did you
      mean that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut up,&rdquo; said Tom, dropping his voice to a surly whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence, during which Murrell studied his friend's face.
      When he spoke, it was to give the conversation a new direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she bring the boy here last night? I saw you drive off with him in
      the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she makes a regular pet of the little ragamuffin&mdash;it's
      perfectly sickening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were the two men with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of 'em calls himself judge Price; the other kept out of the way, I
      didn't hear his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the boy going to stay at Belle Plain?&rdquo; inquired Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That notion hasn't struck her yet, for I heard her say at breakfast that
      she'd take him to Raleigh this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the boy I traveled all the way to North Carolina to get for
      Fentress. I thought I had him once, but the little cuss gave me the slip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh&mdash;you don't say?&rdquo; cried Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, what do you know about the Quintard lands; what do you know about
      Quintard himself?&rdquo; continued Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a rich planter, lived in North Carolina. My father met him when he
      was in congress and got him to invest in land here. They had some
      colonization scheme on foot this was upward of twenty years ago&mdash;but
      nothing came of it. Quintard lost interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he held on to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there much of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred thousand acres,&rdquo; said Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murrell whistled softly under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's it worth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pot of money, two or three dollars an acre anyhow,&rdquo; answered Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quintard has been dead two years, Tom, and back yonder in North Carolina
      they told me he left nothing but the home plantation. The boy lived there
      up to the time of Quintard's death, but what relation he was to the old
      man no one knew. What do you suppose Fentress wants with him? He offered
      me five thousand dollars if I'd bring him West; and he still wants him,
      only he's lying low now to see what comes of the two old sots&mdash;he
      don't want to move in the dark. Offhand, Tom, I'd say that by getting hold
      of the boy Fentress expects to get hold of the Quintard land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's likely,&rdquo; said Ware, then struck by a sudden idea, he added, &ldquo;Are
      you going to take all the risks and let him pocket the cash? If it's the
      land he's after, the stake's big enough to divide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He can have the whole thing and welcome, I'm playing for a bigger stake.&rdquo;
       His friend stared at him in astonishment. &ldquo;I tell you, Tom, I'm bent on
      getting even with the world! No silver spoon came in the way of my mouth
      when I was a youngster; my father was too honest&mdash;and I think the
      less of him for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ware seemed on the whole edified by the captain's unorthodox point of
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother was the true grit though; she came of mountain stock, and
      taught us children to steal by the time we could think! Whatever we stole,
      she hid, and dared my father to touch us. I remember the first thing of
      account was when I was ten years old. A Dutch peddler came to our cabin
      one winter night and begged us to take him in. Of course, he opened his
      pack before he left, and almost under his nose I got away with a bolt of
      linen. The old man and woman fought about it, but if the peddler
      discovered his loss he had the sense not to come back and tell of it! When
      I was seventeen I left home with three good horses I'd picked up; they
      brought me more money than I'd ever seen before and I got my first taste
      of life&mdash;that was in Nashville where I made some good friends with
      whose help I soon had as pretty a trade organized in horseflesh as any one
      could wish.&rdquo; A somber tone had crept into Murrell's voice, while his
      glance had become restless and uneasy. He went on: &ldquo;I'm licking a
      speculation into shape that will cause me to be remembered while there's a
      white man alive in the Mississippi Valley!&rdquo; His wicked black eyes were
      blazing coals of fire in their deep sockets. &ldquo;Have you heard what the
      niggers did at Hayti?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, John&mdash;no, I won't talk to you&mdash;and don't you think
      about it! That's wrong&mdash;wrong as hell itself!&rdquo; cried Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no such thing as right and wrong for me. That'll do for those who
      have something to lose. I was born with empty hands and I am going to fill
      them where and how I can. I believe the time has come when the niggers can
      be of use to me&mdash;look what Turner did back in Virginia three years
      ago! If he'd had any real purpose he could have laid the country waste,
      but he hadn't brains enough to engineer a general uprising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ware was probably as remote from any emotion that even vaguely
      approximated right feeling as any man could well be, but Murrell's words
      jarred his dull conscience, or his fear, into giving signs of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you talk of that business, we want nothing of that sort out here.
      You let the niggers alone!&rdquo; he said, but he could scarcely bring himself
      to believe that Murrell had spoken in earnest. Yet even if he jested, this
      was a forbidden subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White brains will have to think for them, if it's to be more than a flash
      in the pan,&rdquo; said Murrell unheeding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let the niggers alone, don't you tamper with them,&rdquo; said Ware. He
      possessed a profound belief in Murrell's capacity. He knew how the latter
      had shaped the uneasy population that foregathered on the edge of
      civilization to his own ends, and that what he had christened the Clan had
      become an elaborate organization, disciplined and flexible to his ruthless
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, what do you think I have been working for&mdash;to steal a few
      niggers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few&mdash;you've been sending 'em south by the boatload! You ought to
      be a rich man, Murrell. If you're not it's your own fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That furnishes us with money, but you can push the trade too hard and too
      far, and we've about done that. The planters are uneasy in the sections
      we've worked over, there's talk of getting together to clean out everybody
      who can't give a good account of himself. The Clan's got to deal a counter
      blow or go out of business. It was so with the horse trade; in the end it
      became mighty unhandy to move the stock we'd collected. We've reached the
      same point now with the trade in niggers. Between here and the gulf&mdash;&rdquo;
       he made a wide sweeping gesture with his arm. &ldquo;I am spotting the country
      with my men; there are two thousand active workers on the rolls of the
      Clan, and as many more like you, Tom&mdash;and Fentress&mdash;on whose
      friendship I can rely.&rdquo; He leaned toward Ware. &ldquo;You'd be slow to tell me I
      couldn't count on you, Tom, and you'd be slow to think I couldn't manage
      this thing when the time's ripe for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no trace of this all-sufficient sense of confidence, of which he
      seemed so certain, showed on Ware's hardened visage. He spat away the
      stump of his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure as God, John Murrell, you are overreaching yourself! Your white men
      are all right, they've got to stick by you; if they don't they know it's
      only a question of time until they get a knife driven into their ribs&mdash;but
      niggers&mdash;there isn't any real fight in a nigger, if there was they
      wouldn't be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you couldn't have made the whites in Hayti believe that,&rdquo; said
      Murrell, with a sinister smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they were no-account trash themselves!&rdquo; returned Ware, shaking
      his head. &ldquo;We'll all go down in this muss you're fixing for!&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won't, Tom. I'll look out for my friends. You'll be warned in
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hell of a lot of good a warning will do!&rdquo; growled Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The business will be engineered so that you, and those like you, will not
      be disturbed. Maybe the niggers will have control of the country for a day
      or two in the thickly settled parts near the towns; longer, of course,
      where the towns and plantations are scattering. The end will come in the
      swamps and cane-brakes, and the members of the Clan who don't get rich
      while the trouble is at its worst, will have to stay poor. As for the
      niggers, I expect nothing else than that they will be pretty well
      exterminated. But look what that will do for men like yourself, Tom, who
      will have been able to hold on to their slaves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to have some guarantee that I'd be able to; do that! No, sir,
      the devils will all go whooping off to raise hell.&rdquo; Ware shivered at the
      picture his mind had conjured up. &ldquo;Well, thank God, they're not my
      niggers!&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better come with me, Tom,&rdquo; said Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm going to keep New Orleans for myself; that's a plum I'm going to
      pick with the help of a few friends, and I'd cheerfully hang for it
      afterward if I could destroy the city Old Hickory saved&mdash;but I expect
      to quit the country in good time; with a river full of ships I shan't lack
      for means of escape.&rdquo; His manner was cool and decided. He possessed in an
      eminent degree the egotism that makes possible great crimes and great
      criminals, and his degenerate brain dealt with this colossal horror as
      simply as if it had been a petty theft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no use in trying to talk you out of this, John, but I just want
      to ask you one thing: you do all you say you are going to do, and then
      where in hell's name will you be safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take my chances. What have I been taking all my life but the biggest
      sort of chances?&mdash;and for little enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ware, feeling the entire uselessness of argument, uttered a string of
      imprecations, and then fell silent. His acquaintance with Murrell was of
      long standing. It dated back to the time when he was growing into the
      management of Belle Plain. A chance meeting with the outlaw in Memphis had
      developed into the closest intimacy, and the plantation had become one of
      the regular stations for the band of horse-thieves of which Murrell had
      spoken. But time had wrought its changes. Tom was now in full control of
      Belle Plain and its resources, and he had little heart for such risks as
      he had once taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how about the girl, Tom?&rdquo; asked Murrell at length, in a low even
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl? Oh, Betty, you mean?&rdquo; said Ware, and shifted uneasily in his
      seat. &ldquo;Haven't you got enough on your hands without worrying about her?
      She don't like you, haven't I told you that? Think of some one else for a
      spell, and you'll find it answers,&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think is going to happen here if I take your advice? She'll
      marry one of these young bloods!&rdquo; Ware's lips twitched. &ldquo;And then, Tom,
      you'll get your orders to move out, while her husband takes over the
      management of her affairs. What have you put by anyhow?&mdash;enough to
      stock another place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, not a damn cent!&rdquo; said Ware. Murrell laughed incredulously.
      &ldquo;It's so! I've turned it all over&mdash;more lands, more niggers, bigger
      crops each year. Another man might have saved his little spec, but I
      couldn't; I reckon I never believed it would go to her, and I've managed
      Belle Plain as if I were running it for myself.&rdquo; He seemed to writhe as if
      undergoing some acute bodily pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are in a fair way to turn it all over to her husband when she
      marries, and step out of here a beggar, unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't right, John! I haven't had pay for my ability! Why, the place
      would have gone down to nothing with any management but mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she were to die, you'd inherit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ware laughed harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks like dying, doesn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Tom. I'll take her away, and Belle Plain is yours&mdash;land,
      stock and niggers!&rdquo; said Murrell quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ware shifted and twisted in his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be done. I can advise and urge: but I can't command. She's got
      her friends, those people back yonder in North Carolina, and if I made
      things uncomfortable for her here she'd go to them and I couldn't stop
      her. You don't seem to get it through your head that she's got no earthly
      use for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murrell favored him with a contemptuous glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're like every one else! Certain things you'll do, and certain other
      things you won't even try to do&mdash;your conscience or your fear gets in
      your way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it what you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offer to take the girl off your hands; when I quit the country she
      shall go with me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'd be left here to explain what had become of her!&rdquo; cried Ware, in a
      panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't have anything to explain. She'll have disappeared, that will be
      all you'll know,&rdquo; said Murrell quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll never marry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you be too sure of that. She may be glad enough to in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you think you are a hell of a fellow with women! Well, maybe you are
      with one sort&mdash;but what do you know about her kind?&rdquo; jeered the
      planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murrell's brow darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll manage her,&rdquo; he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were of some account until this took hold of you,&rdquo; complained Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say? One would hardly think I was offering to make you a
      present of the best plantation in west Tennessee!&rdquo; said Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ware seemed to suck in hope through his shut teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to know anything about this, you are going to swamp yourself
      yet&mdash;you're fixing to get yourself strung up&mdash;yes, by thunder,
      that'll be your finish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want the land and the niggers? I reckon you'll have to take them
      whether you want them or not, for I'm going to have the girl.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. BOB YANCY FINDS HIMSELF
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Yancy awoke from a long dreamless sleep; heavy-lidded, his eyes slid
      open. For a moment he struggled with the odds and ends of memory, then he
      recalled the fight at the tavern, the sudden murderous attack, the fierce
      blows Slosson had dealt him, the knife thrust which had ended the
      struggle. Therefore, the bandages that now swathed his head and shoulders;
      therefore, the need that he should be up and doing&mdash;for where was
      Hannibal?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought to lift himself on his elbow, but the effort sent shafts of pain
      through him; his head seemed of vast size and endowed with a weight he
      could not support. He sank back groaning, and closed his eyes. After a
      little interval he opened them again and stared about him. There was the
      breath of dawn in the air; he heard a rooster crow, and the contented
      grunting of a pig close at hand. He was resting under a rude shelter of
      poles and bark. Presently he became aware of a slow gliding movement, and
      the silvery ripple of water. Clearly he was no longer at the tavern, and
      clearly some one had taken the trouble to bandage his hurts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length his eyes rolling from side to side focused themselves on a low
      opening near the foot of his shakedown bed. Beyond this opening, and at
      some little distance, he saw a sunbonneted woman of a plump and
      comfortable presence. She was leaning against a tub which rested on a rude
      bench. At her back was another bark shanty similar to the one that
      sheltered himself, while on either hand a shoreless expanse of water
      danced and sparkled under the rays of the newly risen sun. As his eyes
      slowly took in the scene, Yancy's astonishment mounted higher and higher.
      The lady's sunbonnet quite hid her face, but he saw that she was smoking a
      cob-pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still staring at her, when the lank figure of a man emerged from
      the other shanty. This man wore a cotton shirt and patched butternut
      trousers; he way hatless and shoeless, and his hair stood out from his
      head in a great flaming shock. He, too, was smoking a cob-pipe. Suddenly
      the man put out a long arm which found its way about the lady's waist, an
      attention that culminated in a vigorous embrace. Then releasing her, he
      squared his shoulders, took a long breath, beat his chest with the flat of
      his hands and uttered a cheerful whoop. The embrace, the deep breath, and
      the whoop constituted Mr. Cavendish's morning devotions, and were
      expressive of a spirit of thankfulness to the risen sun, his general
      satisfaction with the course of Providence, and his homage to the lady of
      his choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swinging about on his heel, Cavendish passed beyond Yancy's range of
      vision. Again the latter attempted to lift himself on his elbow, but sky
      and water changed places before his eyes and he dropped down on his pillow
      with a stifled sigh. He seemed to be slipping back into the black night
      from which he had just emerged. Again he was at Scratch Hill, again Dave
      Blount was seeking to steal his nevvy&mdash;incidents of the trial and
      flight recurred to him&mdash;all was confused, feverish, without sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a shadow fell obliquely across the foot of his narrow bed, and
      Cavendish, bending his long body somewhat, thrust his head in at the
      opening. He found himself looking into a pair of eyes that for the first
      time in many a long day held the light of consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, stranger?&rdquo; he demanded, in a soft drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; the words were a whisper on Yancy's bearded lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, you are in the Tennessee River fo' certain; my wife will make
      admiration when she hears you speak. Polly! you jest step here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Polly had heard Cavendish speak, and the murmur of Yancy's voice in
      reply. Now her head appeared beside her husband's, and Yancy saw that she
      was rosy and smiling, and that her claim to good looks was something that
      could not well be denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La, you are some better, ain't you, sir?&rdquo; she cried, smiling down on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did I get here, and where's my nevvy?&rdquo; questioned Yancy anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, you ain't in no condition fo' to pester yo'self with worry.
      You was fished up out of the Elk River by Mr. Cavendish,&rdquo; Polly explained,
      still smiling and dimpling at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, ma'am&mdash;last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got another guess coming to you, stranger!&rdquo; It was Cavendish who
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean, sir, that I been unconscious for a spell?&rdquo; suggested Yancy
      rather fearfully, glancing from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been right smart of a spell, too; yes, sir, you've laid like you was
      dead, and not fo' a matter of hours either&mdash;but days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, nigh on to three weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They saw Yancy's eyes widen with a look of dumb horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three weeks!&rdquo; he at length repeated, and groaned miserably. He was
      thinking of Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You was mighty droll to look at when I fished you up out of the river,&rdquo;
       continued Mr. Cavendish. &ldquo;You'd been cut and beat up scandalous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don't know nothing about my nevvy?&mdash;you ain't seen or heard
      of him, ma'am?&rdquo; faltered Yancy, and glanced up into Polly's comely face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly shook her head regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How come you in the river?&rdquo; asked Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I was throwed in. It was a man named Murrell and another man
      named Slosson. They tried fo' to murder me&mdash;they wanted to get my
      nevvy&mdash;I 'low they done it!&rdquo; and Yancy groaned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get him back,&rdquo; said Polly soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you-all put me asho'?&rdquo; inquired Yancy, with sudden eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could, but we won't,&rdquo; said Cavendish, in no uncertain tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, la!&mdash;you'd perish!&rdquo; exclaimed Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we far from where you-all picked me up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cavendish nodded. He did not like to tell Yancy the distance they had
      traversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you-all taking me?&rdquo; asked Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, stranger, that's a question I can't answer offhand. The Tennessee
      are a twister; mebby it will be Kentucky; mebby it will be Illinoy, and
      mebby it will be down yonder on the Mississippi. My tribe like this way of
      moving about, and it certainly favors a body's legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old was your nevvy?&rdquo; inquired Polly, reading the troubled look in
      Yancy's gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten or thereabouts, ma'am. He were a heap of comfort to me,&rdquo; and the
      whisper on Yancy's lips was wonderfully tender and wistful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the age of my Richard,&rdquo; said Polly, her glance full of compassion
      and pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cavendish essayed to speak, but was forced to pause and clear his
      throat. The allusion to Richard in this connection having been almost more
      than he could endure with equanimity. When he was able to put his thoughts
      into words, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shore am distressed fo' you. I tried to leave you back yonder where I
      found you, but no one knowed you and you looked so near dead folks
      wouldn't have it. What parts do you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'th Carolina. Me and my nevvy was a-goin' into west Tennessee to a
      place called Belle Plain, somewhere near Memphis. We have friends there,&rdquo;
       explained Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it!&rdquo; cried Cavendish. &ldquo;It won't be Kentucky, and it won't be
      Illinoy; I'll put you asho' at Memphis; mebby you'll find yo' nevvy there
      after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the best. You lay still and get yo' strength back as fast as you
      can, and try not to worry&mdash;do now.&rdquo; Polly's voice was soft and
      wheedling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I been a heap of bother to you-all,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La, no,&rdquo; Polly assured him; &ldquo;you ain't been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now the six little Cavendishes appeared on the scene. The pore
      gentleman had come to&mdash;sho! He had got his senses back&mdash;sho! he
      wa'n't goin' to die after all; he could talk. Sho! a body could hear him
      plain! Excited beyond measure they scurried about in their fluttering rags
      of nightgowns for a sight and hearing of the pore gentleman. They
      struggled madly to climb over their parents, and failing this&mdash;under
      them. But the opening that served as a door to the shanty being small, and
      being as it was completely stoppered by their father and mother who were
      in no mood to yield an inch, they distributed themselves in quest of
      convenient holes in the bark edifice through which to peer at the pore
      gentleman. And since the number of youthful Cavendishes exceeded the
      number of such holes, the sound of lamentation and recrimination presently
      filled the morning air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kin see the soles of his feet!&rdquo; shrieked Keppel with passionate
      intensity, his small bleached eye glued to a crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was instantly ravished of the sight by Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean hateful thing!&mdash;just because you're bigger than Kep!&rdquo; and
      Constance fell on the spoiler. As her mother's right-hand man she had
      cuffed and slapped her way to a place of power among the little brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cavendish appeared to allay hostilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'low I'll skin you if you don't keep still! Dress!&mdash;the whole kit
      and b'ilin' of you!&rdquo; he roared, and his manner was quite as ferocious as
      his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the six little Cavendishes were impressed by neither. They instantly
      fastened on him like so many leeches. What was the pore gentleman saying?&mdash;why
      couldn't they hear, too? Then they'd keep still, sure they would! Did he
      say he knowed who throwed him in the river?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder, Connie, you ain't able to do more with these here children.
      Seems like you ought to&mdash;a great big girl like you,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Cavendish, reduced to despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Henry pickin' on Kep,&rdquo; cried Constance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found a crack and he took it away from me! drug me off by the legs, he
      did, and filled my stomach full of slivers!&rdquo; wailed Keppel, suddenly
      remembering he had a grievance. &ldquo;You had ought to let me see the pore
      gentleman!&rdquo; he added ingratiatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ain't you been seein' him every day fo' risin' two weeks and
      upwards?&mdash;ain't you sat by him hours at a stretch?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
      Cavendish fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sho&mdash;that didn't count, he only kept a mutterin'&mdash;sho!&mdash;arollin'
      his head sideways, sho! And their six tow heads were rolled to illustrate
      their meaning. And a-pluckin' at a body's hands!&mdash;and they plucked at
      Mr. Cavendish's hands. Sho&mdash;did he say why he done that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you-all will quit yo' noise and dress, you-all kin presently set by
      the pore gentleman. If you don't, I'll have to speak to yo' mother; I 'low
      she'll trim you! I reckon you-all don't want me to call her? No, by
      thunderation!&mdash;because you-all know she won't stand no nonsense!
      She'll fan you; she'll take the flat of her hand to you-all and make you
      skip some; I reckon I'd get into my pants befo' she starts on the warpath.
      I wouldn't give her no such special opportunity as you're offerin'!&rdquo; Mr.
      Cavendish's voice and manner had become entirely confidential and
      sympathetic, and though fear of their mother could not be said to bulk
      high on their horizon, yet the small Cavendishes were persuaded by sheer
      force of his logic to withdraw and dress. Their father hurried back to
      Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just thinkin', sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that if it would be any comfort to
      you, we'll tie up to the bank right here and wait until you can travel.
      I'm powerfully annoyed at having fetched you all this way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Yancy shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be glad to go on to Memphis with you. If my nevvy got away from
      Murrell, that's where I'll find him. I reckon folks will be kind to him
      and sort of help him along. Why, he ain't much mo' than knee high!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore they will! there's a lot of good in the world, so don't you fret
      none about him!&rdquo; cried Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't do much else, ma'am, than think of him bein' lonesome and hungry,
      maybe&mdash;and terribly frightened. What do you-all suppose he thought
      when he woke up and found me gone?&rdquo; But neither Polly nor her husband had
      any opinion to venture on this point. &ldquo;If I don't find him in Memphis I'll
      take the back track to No'th Carolina, stoppin' on the way to see that man
      Slosson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I 'low there's a fit comin' to him when he gets sight of you!&rdquo; and
      Cavendish's bleached blue eyes sparkled at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a heap mo' than a fit. I don't bear malice, but I stay mad a long
      time,&rdquo; answered Yancy grimly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn't talk no mo',&rdquo; said Polly. &ldquo;You must just lay quiet and get
      yo' strength back. Now, I'm goin' to fix you a good meal of vittles.&rdquo; She
      motioned Cavendish to follow her, and they both withdrew from the shanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yancy closed his eyes, and presently, lulled by the soft ripple that bore
      them company, fell into a restful sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he told us of his nevvy, Dick, and I got to thinkin' of his bein'
      just the age of our Richard, I declare it seemed like something got in my
      throat and I'd choke. Do you reckon he'll ever find him?&rdquo; said Polly, as
      she busied herself with preparations for their breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, Polly!&rdquo; said Cavendish, but her words were a powerful assault
      on his feelings, which at all times lay close to the surface and were
      easily stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under stress of his emotions, he now enjoined silence on his family,
      fortifying the injunction with dire threats as to the consequences that
      would descend with lightning&mdash;like suddenness on the head of the
      unlucky sinner who forgot and raised his voice above a whisper. Then he
      despatched a chicken; sure sign that he and Polly considered their guest
      had reached the first stage of convalescence.

      CHAPTER XVIII. AN ORPHAN MAN OF TITLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The raft drifted on into the day's heat; and when at last Yancy awoke, it
      was to find Henry and Keppel seated beside him, each solacing him with a
      small moist hand, while they regarded him out of the serious unblinking
      eyes of childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy!&rdquo; said he, smiling up at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy!&rdquo; they answered, a sociable grin puckering their freckled faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you find yo'self pretty well, sir?&rdquo; inquired Keppel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find myself pretty weak,&rdquo; replied Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me and Kep has been watching fo' to keep the flies from stinging you,&rdquo;
       explained Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-all takes turns doin' that,&rdquo; Keppel added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and how many of you-all are there?&rdquo; asked Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's six of we-uns and the baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They covertly examined this big bearded man who had lost his nevvy, and
      almost his life. They had overheard their father and mother discuss his
      plans and knew when he was recovered from his wounds if he did not
      speedily meet up with his nevvy at a place called Memphis, he was going
      back to Lincoln County, which was near where they came from, to have the
      hide off a gentleman of the name of Slosson. They imagined the gentleman
      named Slosson would find the operation excessively disagreeable; and that
      Yancy should be recuperating for so unique an enterprise invested him with
      a romantic interest. Henry squirmed closer to the recumbent figure on the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me and Kep would like mighty well to know how you-all are goin' to strip
      the hide offen to that gentleman's back,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yancy instantly surmised that the reference was to Slosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I'll feel obliged to just naturally skin him,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho', will he let you do that?&rdquo; they demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't be consulted none. And his hide will come off easy once I get
      hold of him by the scruff of the neck.&rdquo; Yancy's speech was gentle and his
      lips smiling, but he meant a fair share of what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho', is that the way you do it?&rdquo; And round-eyed they gazed down on this
      fascinating stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may have to touch him up with a tickler,&rdquo; continued Yancy, who did not
      wish to prove disappointing. &ldquo;I reckon you-all know what a tickler is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if Mr. Slosson totes a tickler, too?&rdquo; asked Keppel insinuatingly.
      This opened an inviting field for conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won't make no manner of difference. Why? Because it's a powerful
      drawback fo' a man to know he's in the wrong, just as it's a heap in yo'
      favor to know you're in the right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father's got a tickler; I seen it often,&rdquo; vouchsafed Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a foot long, with a buck horn handle. Gee whiz!&mdash;he keeps it
      keen; but he never uses it on no humans,&rdquo; said Keppel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he don't; he's a high-spirited, right-actin' gentleman. But
      what do you reckon he'd feel obliged to do if a body stole one of
      you-all?&rdquo; inquired Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoop! He'd carve 'em deep!&rdquo; cried Keppel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mrs. Cavendish appeared, bringing Yancy's breakfast. In her
      wake came Connie with the baby, and the three little brothers who were to
      be accorded the cherished privilege of seeing the poor gentleman eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got a nice little family, ma'am,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon nobody complains mo' about their children than me, but I
      reckon nobody gets mo' comfort out of their children either. I hope
      you-all are a-goin' to be able to eat, you ain't had much nourishment. La,
      does yo' shoulder pain you like that? Want I should feed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, ma'am, but I reckon you'll have to,&rdquo; Yancy spoke regretfully.
      &ldquo;I expect I been a passel of bother to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you ain't. Here's Dick to see how you make out with the chicken,&rdquo;
       Polly added, as Cavendish presented himself at the opening that did duty
      as a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This looks like bein' alive, stranger,&rdquo; he commented genially. He
      surveyed the group of which Yancy was the center. &ldquo;If them children gets
      too numerous, just throw 'em out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You-all ain't told me yo' name yet?&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Cavendish. Richard Keppel Cavendish, to get it all off my mind at a
      mouthful. And this lady's Mrs. Cavendish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name's Yancy&mdash;Bob Yancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cavendish exchanged glances with Mrs. Cavendish. By a nod of her
      dimpled chin the lady seemed to urge some more extended confidence on his
      part. Chills and Fever seated himself at the foot of Yancy's bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stranger, what I'm a-goin' to tell you, you'll take as bein' said man to
      man,&rdquo; he began, with the impressive air of one who had a secret of great
      moment to impart; and Yancy hastened to assure him that whatever passed
      between them, his lips should be sealed. &ldquo;It ain't really that, but I
      don't wish to appear proud afo' no man's, eyes. First, I want to ask you,
      did you ever hear tell of titles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Polly and the children hung breathlessly on Mr. Yancy's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly have,&rdquo; he rejoined promptly. &ldquo;Back in No'th Carolina we went
      by the chimneys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chimneys? What's chimneys got to do with titles, Mr. Yancy?&rdquo; asked Polly,
      while her husband appeared profoundly mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A whole lot, ma'am. If a man had two chimneys to his house we always
      called him Colonel, if there was four chimneys we called him General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La!&rdquo; cried Polly, smiling and showing a number of new dimples. &ldquo;Dick
      don't mean militia titles, Mr. Yancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them's the only ones I know anything of,&rdquo; confessed Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever hear tell of lords?&rdquo; inquired Chills and Fever, tilting his head on
      one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And Yancy was quick to notice the look of disappointment on the
      faces of his new friends. He felt that for some reason, which was by no
      means clear to him, he had lost caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ever heard of royalty?&rdquo; and Cavendish fixed the invalid's
      wandering glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean kings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shore do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yancy regarded him reflectively and made a mighty mental effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's them Bible kings&mdash;&rdquo; he ventured at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cavendish shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them's sacred kings. Are you familiar with any of the profane kings, Mr.
      Yancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, taking them as they come, them Bible kings seemed to average pretty
      profane.&rdquo; Yancy was disposed to defend this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must a heard of the kings of England. Sho', wa'n't any of yo' folks
      in the war agin' him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd plumb forgot, why my daddy fit all through that war!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Yancy. The Cavendishes were immensely relieved. Polly beamed on the
      invalid, and the children hunched closer. Six pairs of eager lips were
      trembling on the verge of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you-all keep still,&rdquo; said Cavendish. &ldquo;I want Mr. Yancy should get the
      straight of this here! The various orders of royalty are kings, dukes,
      earls and lords. Earls is the third from the top of the heap, but lords
      ain't no slouch; it's a right neat little title, and them that has it can
      turn round in most any company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick had ought to know, fo' he's an earl himself,&rdquo; cried Polly
      exultantly, unable to restrain herself any longer, while a mutter came
      from the six little Cavendishes who had been wonderfully silent for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho', Richard Keppel Cavendish, Earl of Lambeth! 'Sho', that was what he
      was! Sho'!&rdquo; and some transient feeling of awe stamped itself upon their
      small faces as they viewed the long and limber figure of their parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that mo' than a Colonel?&rdquo; Yancy risked the question hesitatingly, but
      he felt that speech was expected from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the possessor of the title.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would a General lay it over you any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, he wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yancy gazed respectfully but uncertainly at Chills and Fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then all I got to say is that I've traveled considerably, mostly between
      Scratch Hill and Balaam's Cross Roads, meeting with all kinds of folks;
      but I never seen an earl afo. I take it they are some scarce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are. I don't reckon there's another one but me in the whole United
      States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of that!&rdquo; gasped Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ain't nothin' fo' style, it bein' my opinion that where a man's a born
      gentleman he's got a heap of reason fo' to be grateful but none to brag,&rdquo;
       said Cavendish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick's kind of titles are like having red hair and squint eyes. Once they
      get into a family they stick,&rdquo; explained Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've noticed that, 'specially about squint eyes.&rdquo; Yancy was glad to plant
      his feet on familiar ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These here titles go to the eldest son. He begins by bein' a viscount,&rdquo;
       continued Chills and Fever. He wished Yancy to know the full measure of
      their splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And their wives are ladies-ain't they, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cavendish nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody with half an eye would know you was a lady, ma'am,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kep here is an Honorable, same as a senator or a congressman,&rdquo; Cavendish
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At his age, too!&rdquo; commented Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my daughter's the Lady Constance,&rdquo; said Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Havin' such a mother she ain't no choice,&rdquo; observed Yancy, with an air of
      gentle deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick's got the family, Mr. Yancy. My folks, the Rhetts, was plain
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of 'em ain't so noticeably plain, either,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho', you've a heap of good sense, Mr. Yancy!&rdquo; and Cavendish shook him
      warmly by the hand. &ldquo;The first time I ever seen her, I says, I'll marry
      that lady if it takes an arm! Well, it did most of the time while I was
      co'tin' her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La!&rdquo; cried Polly, blushing furiously. &ldquo;You shouldn't tell that, Dick. Mr.
      Yancy ain't interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I'd been hearin' about old man Rhett's Polly fo' considerable
      of a spell,&rdquo; said Cavendish, looking at Polly reflectively. &ldquo;He lived up
      at the head waters of the Elk River. Fellows who had been to his place,
      when girls was mentioned would sort of shake their heads sad-like and say,
      'Yes, but you had ought to see old man Rhett's Polly, all the rest is
      imitations!' Seemed like they couldn't get her off their minds. So I just
      slung my kit to my back, shouldered my rifle, and hoofed it up-stream. I
      says, I'll see for myself where this here paragon lays it all over the
      rest of her sect, but sho&mdash;the closter I came to old man Rhett the
      mo' I heard of Polly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, how you do run on,&rdquo; cried Polly protestingly, but Chills and
      Fever's knightly soul dwelt in its illusions, and the years had not made
      stale his romance. Also Polly was beaming on him with a wealth of
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seen her fo' the first time as I was warmin' the trail within a mile of
      old man Rhett's. She was carrying a grist of co'n down to the mill in her
      father's ox cart. When I clapped eyes on her I says, 'I'll marry that
      lady. I'll make her the Countess of Lambeth&mdash;she'll shore do fo' the
      peerage any day!' That was yo' mommy, sneezic's!&rdquo; Mr. Cavendish paused to
      address himself to the baby whom Connie had relinquished to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet I made time the rest of the way. I says, 'She's sixteen if she's
      a day, and all looks!' I broke into old man Rhett's clearin' on a keen
      run. He was a settin' afo' his do' smokin' his pipe and he glanced me over
      kind of weary-like and says, 'Howdy!' It wa'n't much of a greetin' the way
      he said it either; but I figured it was some better than bein' chased off
      the place. So I stepped indo's, stood my rifle in a corner and hung up my
      cap. He was watchin' me and presently he drawled out, 'Make yo'self
      perfectly at home, stranger.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I says, 'Squire'&mdash;he wa'n't a squire, but they called him that&mdash;I
      says, 'Squire, my name's Cavendish. Let's get acquainted quick. I'm here
      fo' to co'te yo' Polly. I seen her on the road a spell back and I couldn't
      be better suited.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says, 'You had ought to be kivered up in salt, young man, else yo'll
      spile in this climate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I says, 'I'll keep in any climate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says, 'Polly ain't givin' her thoughts much to marryin', she's busy
      keepin' house fo' her pore old father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I says, 'I've come here special fo' to arouse them thoughts you mention.
      If I seem slow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says, 'You don't. If this is yo' idea of bein' slow, I'd wish to avoid
      you when you was in a hurry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I says, 'Put in yo' spare moments thinkin' up a suitable blessin' fo'
      us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says, 'You'll have yo' hands full. There's a number of young fellows
      hereabouts that you don't lay it over none in p'int of freshness or
      looks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I says, 'Does she encourage any of 'em?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says, 'Nope, she don't. Ain't I been tellin' you she's givin' her mind
      to keepin' house fo' her pore old father?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I says, 'If she don't encourage 'em none, she shore must disencourage
      'em. I 'low she gets my help in that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says, 'They'll run you so far into the mountings, Mr. Cavendish,
      you'll never be heard tell of again in these parts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I says, 'I'll bust the heads offen these here galoots if they try that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asks, grinnin', 'Have you arranged how yo' remains are to be sent back
      to yo' folks?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I says, 'I'm an orphan man of title, a peer of England, and you can leave
      me lay if it cones to that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,'. he says, 'if them's yo' wishes, the buzzards as good as got
      you.&rdquo;' Cavendish lapsed into a momentary silence. It was plain that these
      were cherished memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I call co'tin!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Yancy, with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Lambeth resumed
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was as bad as old man Rhett said it was. Sundays his do'yard looked
      like a militia muster. They told it on him that he hadn't cut a stick of
      wood since Polly was risin' twelve. I reckon, without exaggeration, I fit
      every unmarried man in that end of the county, and two lookin' widowers
      from Nashville. I served notice on to them that I'd attend to that
      woodpile of old man Rhett's fo' the future; that I was qualifying fo' to
      be his son-in-law, and seekin' his indorsement as a provider. I took 'em
      on one at a time as they happened along, and lambasted 'em all over the
      place. As fo' the Nashville widowers,&rdquo; said Cavendish with a chuckle, and
      a nod to Polly, &ldquo;I pretty nigh drownded one of 'em in the Elk. We met in
      mid-stream and fit it out there; and the other quit the county. That was
      fo'teen years ago; but, mind you, I'd do it all over again to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Dick, you ain't telling Mr. Yancy nothin' about yo' title,&rdquo;
       expostulated Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd admire to hear mo' about that,&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm gettin' round to that. It was my great grandfather come over here
      from England. His name was Richard Keppel Cavendish, same as mine is. He
      lived back yonder on the Carolina coast and went to raisin' tobacco. I've
      heard my grandfather tell how he'd heard folks say his father was always
      hintin' in his licker that he was a heap better than he seemed, and if
      people only knowed the truth about him they'd respect him mo', and mebby
      treat him better. Well, sir, he married and riz a family; there was my
      grandfather and a passel of girls&mdash;and that crop of children was the
      only decent crop he ever riz. I've heard my grandfather tell how, when he
      got old enough to notice such things, he seen that his father had the look
      of a man with something mysterious hangin' over him, but he couldn't make
      it out what it was, though he gave it a heap of study. He seen, too, that
      let him get a taste of licker and he'd begin to throw out them hints, how
      if folks only knowed the truth they'd be just naturally fallin' over
      themselves fo' to do him a favor, instead of pickin' on him and tryin' to
      down him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather said he never knowed a man, either, with the same aversion
      agin labor as his father had. Folks put it down to laziness, but they
      misjudged him, as come out later, yet he never let on. He just went around
      sorrowful-like, and when there was a piece of work fo' him to do he'd
      spend a heap of time studyin' it, or mebby he'd just set and look at it
      until he was ready fo' to give it up. Appeared like he couldn't bring
      himself down to toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then one day he got his hands on a paper that had come acrost in a ship
      from England. He was readin' it, settin' in the shade; my grandfather said
      he always noticed he was partial to the shade, and his wife was pesterin'
      of him fo' to go and plow out his truck-patch, when, all at once, he lit
      on something in the paper, and he started up and let out a yell like he'd
      been shot. 'By gum, I'm the Earl of Lambeth!' he says, and took out to the
      nearest tavern and got b'ilin' full. Afterward he showed 'em the paper and
      they seen with their own eyes where Richard Keppel Cavendish, Earl of
      Lambeth, had died in London. My great grandfather told 'em that was his
      uncle; that when he left home there was several cousins&mdash;which was
      printed in the paper, too&mdash;but they'd up and died, so the title
      naturally come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, that was the first the family ever knowed of it, and then they
      seen what it was he'd meant when he throwed out them hints about bein' a
      heap better than he seemed. He said perhaps he wouldn't never have told,
      only he couldn't bear to be misjudged like he'd always been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never done a lick of work after that. He said he couldn't bring
      himself down to it; that it was demeanin' fo' a person of title fo' to
      labor with his hands like a nigger or a common white man. He said he'd
      leave it to his family to see he didn't come to want, it didn't so much
      matter about them; and he lived true to his principles to the day of his
      death, and never riz his hand except to feed himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cavendish paused. Yancy was feeling that in his own person he had
      experienced some of the best symptoms of a title.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, he lived along like that, never complainin', my grandfather
      said, but mighty sweet and gentlelike as long as there was plenty to eat
      in the house. He lived to be nigh eighty, and when he seen he was goin' to
      die he called my grandfather to him and says, 'She's yours, Dick,'&mdash;meanin'
      the title&mdash;and then he says, 'There's one thing I've kep' from you.
      You've been a viscount ever since I come into the title, and then he went
      on and explained what he wanted cut on his tombstone, and had my
      grandfather write it out, so there couldn't be any mistake. When he'd
      passed away, my grandfather took the title. He said it made him feel
      mighty solemn and grand-like, and it come over him all at once why it was
      his father hadn't no heart fo' work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it always take 'em that way?&rdquo; inquired Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes the Earls of Lambeth that way. I reckon you might say it was
      hereditary with 'em. Where was I at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandpap, the second earl,&rdquo; prompted Polly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;well, he 'lowed he'd emigrate back to England, but while he
      was studying how he could do this, along come the war. He said he couldn't
      afford to fight agin his king, so he pulled out and crossed the mountings
      to avoid being drug into the army. He said he couldn't let it get around
      that the Earls of Lambeth was shootin' English soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he couldn't,&rdquo; agreed Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been my dream to take Polly and the children and go back to England
      and see the king about my title. I 'low he'd be some surprised to see us.
      I'd like to tell him, too, what the Earls of Lambeth done fo' him&mdash;that
      they was always loyal, and thought a heap better of him than their
      neighbors done, and mebby some better than he deserved. Don't you reckon
      that not hearin' from us, he's got the notion the Cavendishes has petered
      out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Yancy considered this likely, and said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might send him writin' in a letter,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furious shrieking of a steam-packet's whistle broke in upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's another of them hawgs, wantin' all the river!&rdquo; said Mr. Cavendish,
      and fled in haste to the steering oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all the long days that followed, Mr. Yancy was forced to own that
      these titled friends of his were, despite their social position, uncommon
      white in their treatment of him. The Earl of Lambeth consorted with him in
      that fine spirit that recognizes the essential brotherhood of man, while
      his Lady Countess was, as Yancy observed, on the whole, a person of simple
      and uncorrupted tastes. She habitually went barefoot, both as a matter of
      comfort and economy, and she smoked her cob-pipe as did those other ladies
      of Lincoln County who had married into far less exalted stations than her
      own. He put these simple survivals down to her native goodness of heart,
      which would not allow of her succumbing to mere pride and vainglory, for
      he no more doubted their narrative than they, doubted it themselves, which
      was not at all.

      CHAPTER XIX. THE JUDGE SEES A GHOST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Charley Norton's good offices did not end when he had furnished judge
      Price with a house, for Betty required of him that he should supply that
      gentleman with legal business as well. When she pointed out the necessity
      of this, Norton demurred. He had no very urgent need of a lawyer, and had
      the need existed, Slocum Price would not have been his choice. Betty knit
      her brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have a chance; perhaps if people knew you employed him it would
      give them confidence&mdash;you must realize this, Charley; it isn't enough
      that he has a house&mdash;he can't wear it nor eat it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And fortunately he can't drink it, either. I don't want to discourage
      you, but his looks are all against him, Betty. If you take too great an
      interest in his concerns I am afraid you are going to have him permanently
      on your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you some little scrap of business that really doesn't matter
      much, Charley? You might try him&mdash;just to please me&mdash;&rdquo; she
      persisted coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's land I'm buying&mdash;I suppose I could get him to look up
      the title, I know it's all right anyhow,&rdquo; said Norton, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that judge Price, before he had been three days in
      Raleigh, received a civil note from Mr. Norton asking him to search the
      title to a certain timber tract held by one Joseph Quaid; a communication
      the effect of which was out of all proportion to the size of the fee
      involved. The judge, powerfully excited, told Mahaffy he was being
      understood and appreciated; that the tide of prosperity was clearly
      setting his way; that intelligent foresight, not chance, had determined
      him when he selected Raleigh instead of Memphis. Thereafter he spoke of
      Charley Norton only as &ldquo;My client,&rdquo; and exalted him for his breeding,
      wealth and position, refusing to admit that any man in the county was held
      in quite the same esteem. All of which moved Mahaffy to flashes of grim
      sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate result of Norton's communication had been to send the judge
      up the street to the courthouse. He would show his client that he could be
      punctual and painstaking. He should have his abstract of title without
      delay; moreover, he had in mind a scholarly effort entirely worthy of
      himself. The dull facts should be illuminated with an occasional striking
      phrase. He considered that it would doubtless be of interest to Mr.
      Norton, in this connection, to know something, too, of mediaeval land
      tenure, ancient Roman and modern English. He proposed artfully to pander
      to his client's literary tastes&mdash;assuming that he had such tastes.
      But above all, this abstract must be entirely explanatory of himself,
      since its final purpose was to remove whatever doubts his mere appearance
      might have bred in Mr. Norton's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my pocket could just be brought to stand the strain of new clothes
      before the next sitting of court, I might reasonably hope for a share of
      the pickings,&rdquo; thought the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the court-house, he found himself in a narrow hall. On his right
      was the jury-room, and on his left the county clerk's office, stuffy
      little holes, each lighted by a single window. Beyond, and occupying the
      full width of the building, was the court-room, with its hard, wooden
      benches and its staring white walls. Advancing to the door, which stood
      open, the judge surveyed the room with the greatest possible satisfaction.
      He could fancy it echoing to that eloquence of which he felt himself to be
      the master. He would show the world, yet, what was in him, and especially
      Solomon Mahaffy, who clearly had not taken his measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning away from the agreeable picture his mind had conjured up, he
      entered the county clerk's office. He was already known to this official,
      whose name was Saul, and he now greeted him with a pleasant air of
      patronage. Mr. Saul removed his feet from the top of his desk and motioned
      his visitor to a chair; at the same time he hospitably thrust forward a
      square box filled with sawdust. It was plain he labored under the
      impression that the judge's call was of an unprofessional character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little matter of business brings me here, sir,&rdquo; began the judge, with a
      swelling chest and mellow accents. &ldquo;No, sir, I'll not be seated&mdash;another
      time I'll share your leisure if I may&mdash;now I am in some haste to look
      up a title for my client, Mr. Norton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Norton?&rdquo; asked Mr. Saul, when he had somewhat recovered from the
      effect of this announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Charles Norton, of Thicket Point,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you mean that timber tract of old Joe Quaid's.&rdquo; Mr. Saul viewed
      the judge's ruinous exterior with a glance of respectful awe, for clearly
      a man who could triumph over such a handicap must possess uncommon merit
      of some sort. &ldquo;So you're looking after Charley Norton's business for him,
      are you?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a client of mine. We have mutual friends, sir&mdash;I refer to Miss
      Malroy,&rdquo; the judge vouchsafed to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're naming our best people, sir, when you name the Malroys and the
      Nortons; they are pretty much in a class by themselves,&rdquo; said Mr. Saul,
      whose awe of the judge was momentarily increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't underestimate the value of a social endorsement, sir, but I've
      never stood on that,&rdquo; observed the judge. &ldquo;I've come amongst you
      unheralded, but I expect you to find me out. Now, sir, if you'll be good
      enough, I'll glance at the record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saul scrambled up out of the depths of his chair and exerted himself
      in the judge's behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what you want, sir. Better take the ledger to the window, the
      light in here ain't much.&rdquo; He drew forward a chair as he spoke, and the
      judge, seating himself, began to polish his spectacles with great
      deliberation. He felt that he had reached a crisis in his career, and was
      disposed to linger over the hope that was springing up in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does the docket for the next term of court stand?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty fair, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any litigation of unusual interest in prospect?&rdquo; The judge was fitting
      his glasses to the generous arch of his nose, a feature which nicely
      indexed its owner's habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, just the ordinary run of cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped to hear you say different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've set on the bench, sir?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one of the eastern counties, but my inclination has never been toward
      the judiciary. My temperament, sir, is distinctly aggressive&mdash;and
      each one according to the gifts with which God has been graciously pleased
      to endow him! I am frank to say, however, that my decisions have received
      their meed of praise from men thoroughly competent to speak on such
      matters.&rdquo; He was turning the leaves of the ledger as he spoke. Suddenly
      the movement of his hand was arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Saul. But the judge gave him no answer; absorbed and
      aloof he was staring down at the open pages of the book. &ldquo;Found the
      entry?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&mdash;what's that? No&mdash;&rdquo; he appeared to hesitate. &ldquo;Who is this
      man Quintard?&rdquo; The question cost him an effort, that was plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's the owner of a hundred-thousand-acre tract in this and abutting
      counties,&rdquo; said Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge continued to stare down at the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a resident of the county?&rdquo; he asked, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he lives back yonder in North Carolina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred thousand acres!&rdquo; the judge muttered thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There or thereabouts&mdash;yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has charge of the land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Fentress; he was old General Ware's law partner. I've heard it
      was the general who got this man Quintard to make the investment, but that
      was before my time in these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge lapsed into a heavy, brooding silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A step sounded in the narrow hall. An instant later the door was pushed
      open, and grateful for any interruption that would serve to take Mr.
      Saul's attention from himself, the judge abruptly turned his back on the
      clerk and began to examine the record before him. Engrossed in this, he
      was at first scarcely aware of the conversation that was being carried on
      within a few feet of him. Insensibly, however, the cold, level tones of
      the voice that was addressing itself to Mr. Saul quickened the beat of his
      pulse, the throb of his heart, and struck back through the years to a day
      from which he reckoned time. The heavy, calf-bound volume in his hand
      shook like a leaf in a gale. He turned slowly, as if in dread of what he
      might see.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he saw was a man verging on sixty, lean and dark, with thin, shaven
      cheeks of a bluish cast above the jaw, and a strongly aquiline profile.
      Long, black locks swept the collar of his coat, while his tall, spare
      figure was habited in sleek broadcloth and spotless linen. For a moment
      the judge seemed to struggle with doubt and uncertainty, then his face
      went a ghastly white and the book slipped from his nerveless fingers to
      the window ledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger, his business concluded, swung about on his heel and quitted
      the office. The judge, his eyes starting from their sockets, stared after
      him; the very breath died on his lips; speechless and motionless, he was
      still seeing that tall, spare figure as it had passed before him, but his
      memories stripped a weight of thirty years from those thin shoulders. At
      last, heavy-eyed and somber, he glanced about him. Mr. Saul, bending above
      his desk, was making an entry in one of his ledgers. The judge shuffled to
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that man?&rdquo; he asked thickly, resting a shaking hand on the
      clerk's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That?&mdash;Oh, that was Colonel Fentress I was just telling you about.&rdquo;
       He looked up from his writing. &ldquo;Hello! You look like you'd seen a ghost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the heat in here&mdash;I reckon&mdash;&rdquo; said the judge, and began to
      mop his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever seen the colonel before?&rdquo; asked Mr. Saul curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, he's one of our leading planters, and a mighty fine lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he always lived here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he came into the county about ten years ago, and bought a place
      called The Oaks, over toward the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he&mdash;has he a family?&rdquo; The judge appeared to be having difficulty
      with his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that anybody knows of. Some say he's a widower, others again say he's
      an old bachelor; but he don't say nothing, for the colonel is as close as
      wax about his own affairs. So it's pure conjecture, sir.&rdquo; There was a
      brief silence. &ldquo;The county has its conundrums, and the colonel's one of
      them,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The colonel's got his friends, to be sure, but he don't mix much with the
      real quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's apparently as high-toned a gentleman as you'd meet with anywhere;
      polished, sir, so smooth your fingers would slip if you tried to take hold
      of him, but it's been commented on that when a horsethief or counterfeiter
      gets into trouble the colonel's always first choice for counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get's 'em off, does he?&rdquo; The judge spoke somewhat grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty nigh always. But then he has most astonishing luck in the matter
      of witnesses. That's been commented on too.&rdquo; The judge nodded
      comprehendingly. &ldquo;I reckon you'd call Tom Ware, out at Belle Plain, one of
      Fentress' closest friends. He's another of your conundrums. I wouldn't
      advise you to be too curious about the colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; The judge was frowning now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will make you unpopular with a certain class. Those of us who've been
      here long enough have learned that there are some of these conundrums we'd
      best not ask an answer for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge pondered this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, sir, that freedom of speech is not allowed?&rdquo; he
      demanded, with some show of heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfect freedom, if you pick and choose your topic,&rdquo; responded Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; ejaculated the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you might talk to me with all the freedom you like, but I'd recommend
      you were cautious with strangers. There have been those who've talked
      freely that have been advised to keep still or harm would come of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did harm come of it?&rdquo; asked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They always kept still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by talking freely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like asking how so and so got the money to buy his last batch of
      niggers,&rdquo; explained Mr. Saul rather vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Colonel Fentress is one of those about whose affairs it is best not
      to show too much curiosity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, decidedly. His friends appear to set a heap by him. Another of his
      particular intimates is a gentleman by the name of Murrell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've met him,&rdquo; he said briefly. &ldquo;Does he belong hereabouts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, hardly; he seems to hold a sort of roving commission. His home is, I
      believe, near Denmark, in Madison County.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's his antecedents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's as common a white man as ever came out of the hills, but he appears
      to stand well with Colonel Fentress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Fentress!&rdquo; The judge spat in sheer disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't appear to fancy the colonel&mdash;&rdquo; said Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't fancy wearing a gag&mdash;and damned if I do!&rdquo; cried the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it ain't that exactly; it's just minding your own business. I reckon
      you'll find there's lot's to be said in favor of goin' ca'mly on attending
      strictly to your own affairs, sir,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting on a sudden impulse, the judge turned to the door. The business and
      the hope that had brought him there were forgotten. He muttered something
      about returning later, and hastily quitted the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon he's a conundrum too!&rdquo; reflected Mr. Saul, as the door
      swung shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall the judge's steps dragged and his head was bowed. He was busy
      with his memories, memories that spanned the desolate waste of years in
      which he had walked from shame to shame, each blacker than the last. Then
      passion shook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn him&mdash;may God-for ever damn him!&rdquo; he cried under his breath, in
      a fierce whisper. A burning mist before his eyes, he shuffled down the
      hall, down the steps, and into the shaded, trampled space that was known
      as the court-house yard. Here he paused irresolutely. Across the way was
      the gun-maker's shop, the weather-beaten sign came within range of his
      vision, and the dingy white letters on their black ground spelled
      themselves out. The words seemed to carry some message, for the judge,
      with his eyes fixed on the sign as on some beacon of hope, plunged across
      the dusty road and entered the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper that night it was plain to both Mr. Mahaffy and Hannibal that
      the judge was in a state of mind best described as beatific. The tenderest
      consideration, the gentlest courtesy flowed from him as from an unfailing
      spring; not that he was ever, even in his darkest hours, socially remiss,
      but there was now a special magnificence to his manner that bred suspicion
      in Mahaffy's soul. When he noted that the judge's shoes were extremely
      dusty, this suspicion shaped itself definitely. He was convinced that on
      the strength of his prospective fee the judge had gone to Belle Plain, for
      what purpose Mr. Mahaffy knew only too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It took you some time to get up that abstract, didn't it, Price?&rdquo; he
      presently said, with artful indirection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go on with that in the morning, Solomon; my interest was
      dissipated this evening,&rdquo; rejoined the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks as though you had devoted a good part of your time to
      pedestrianism,&rdquo; suggested Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right, so I did, Solomon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you at Belle Plain?&rdquo; demanded Mahaffy harshly and with a black
      scowl. The judge had agreed to keep away from Belle Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Solomon, you forget our pact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am glad you remembered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They finished supper, the dishes were cleared away and the candles
      lighted, when the judge produced a mysterious leather-covered case. This
      he placed upon the table and opened, and Mahaffy and Hannibal, who had
      drawn near, saw with much astonishment that it held a handsome pair of
      dueling pistols, together with all their necessary paraphernalia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get 'em, Judge?&mdash;Oh, ain't they beautiful!&rdquo; cried
      Hannibal, circling about the table in his excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lad, they were purchased only a few hours ago,&rdquo; said the judge
      quietly, as he began to load them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake, Price, do be careful!&rdquo; warned Mahaffy, who had a
      horror of pistols that extended to no other species of firearm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall observe all proper caution, Solomon,&rdquo; the judge assured him
      sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge, may I try 'em some day?&rdquo; asked Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my boy, that's part of a gentleman's education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, look out you don't shoot him before his education begins,&rdquo; snapped
      Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you buy 'em?&rdquo; Hannibal was dodging about the judge, the better
      to follow the operation of loading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the gunsmith's, dear lad. It occurred to me that we required small
      arms. If you'll stand quietly at my elbow and not hop around, you'll
      relieve Mr. Mahaffy's apprehension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Price, you need a guardian, if ever a man did!&rdquo; cried Mahaffy,
      in a tone of utter exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Solomon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&mdash;they are absolutely useless. It was a waste of good money that
      you'll be sorry about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, Solomon&mdash;they ain't paid for!&rdquo; said the judge, with a
      thick little chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't do you the injustice to suppose they were; but you haven't any
      head for business; aren't you just that much nearer the time when not a
      soul here will trust you? That's just like you, to plunge ahead and use up
      your credit on gimcracks!&rdquo; Mahaffy prided himself on his acquaintance with
      the basic principles of economics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can sell 'em again,&rdquo; observed the judge placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For less than half what they are worth!&mdash;I never knew so poor a
      manager!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pistols were soon loaded, and the judge turned to Hannibal. &ldquo;I
      regretted that you were not with me out at Boggs' this evening, Hannibal;
      you would have enjoyed seeing me try these weapons there. Now carry a
      candle into the kitchen and place it on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy laughed contemptuously, but was relieved to know the purpose to
      which the judge had devoted the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What aspersion is rankling for utterance within you now, Solomon?&rdquo; said
      the judge tolerantly. Assuming a position that gave him an unobstructed
      view across the two rooms, he raised the pistol in his hand and discharged
      it in that brief instant when he caught the candle's flame between the
      notches of the sight, but he failed to snuff the candle, and a look of
      bitter disappointment passed over his face. He picked up the other pistol.
      &ldquo;This time&mdash;&rdquo; he muttered under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try blowing it out try the snuffers!&rdquo; jeered Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This time!&rdquo; repeated the judge, unheeding him, and as the pistol-shot
      rang out the light vanished. &ldquo;By Heaven, I did it!&rdquo; roared the judge,
      giving way to an uncontrollable burst of feeling. &ldquo;I did it&mdash;and I
      can 'do it again&mdash;light the candle, Hannibal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to load the pistols afresh with feverish haste, and Mahaffy,
      staring at him in amazement, saw that of a sudden the sweat was dripping
      from him. But the judge's excitement prevented his attempting another shot
      at once, twice his hand was raised, twice it was lowered, the third time
      the pistol cracked and the candle's flame was blown level, fluttered for a
      brief instant, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I nick the tallow, Hannibal?&rdquo; The judge spoke anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, both shots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must remedy that,&rdquo; said the judge. Then, as rapidly as he could load
      and fire, bullet after bullet was sent fairly through the flame,
      extinguishing it each time. Mahaffy was too astonished at this display of
      skill even to comment, while Hannibal's delight knew no bounds. &ldquo;That will
      do!&rdquo; said the judge at last. He glanced down at the pistol in his hand.
      &ldquo;This is certainly a gentleman's weapon!&rdquo; he murmured.

      CHAPTER XX. THE WARNING
    </h2>
    <p>
      Norton had ridden down to Belle Plain ostensibly to view certain of those
      improvements that went so far toward embittering Tom Ware's existence.
      Gossip had it that he kept the road hot between the two places, and this
      was an added strain on the planter. But Norton did not go to Belle Plain
      to see Mr. Ware. If that gentleman had been the sole attraction, he would
      have made just one visit suffice; had it preceded his own, he would have
      attended Tom's funeral, and considered that he had done a very decent
      thing. On the present occasion he and Betty were strolling about the
      rehabilitated grounds, and Norton was exhibiting that interest and
      enthusiasm which Betty always expected of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are certainly making the old place look up!&rdquo; he said, as they passed
      out upon the terrace. He had noted casually when he rode up the lane half
      an hour before that a horse was tied near Ware's office; a man now issued
      from the building and swung himself into the saddle. Norton turned
      abruptly to Betty. &ldquo;What's that fellow doing here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he comes to see Tom,&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he here often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day or so.&rdquo; Betty's tone was indifferent. For reasons which had
      seemed good and sufficient she had never discussed Captain Murrell with
      Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day or so?&rdquo; repeated Norton. &ldquo;But you don't see him, Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom has no business allowing that fellow around; if he don't know this
      some one ought to tell him!&rdquo; Norton was working himself up into a fine
      rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't bother me, Charley, if that's what you're thinking of. Let's
      talk of something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd better not, or I'll make it a quarrel with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn't think of that, Charley, indeed you mustn't!&rdquo; cried Betty
      in some alarm, for young Mr. Norton was both impulsive and hot-headed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just how often is Murrell here?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you&mdash;every few days. He and Tom seem wonderfully congenial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom always sees him in his office,&rdquo; explained Betty. She might have made
      her explanation fuller on this point had she cared to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the first decent thing I ever heard of Tom!&rdquo; said Norton with
      warmth. &ldquo;But he ought to kick him off the place the first chance he gets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Belle Plain is ever going to look as it did, Charley?&mdash;as
      we remember it when we were children?&rdquo; asked Betty, giving a new direction
      to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course it is, dear, you are doing wonders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've really been ashamed of the place, the way it looked&mdash;and I
      can't understand Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to,&rdquo; advised Norton. &ldquo;Look here, Betty, do you remember it was
      right on this terrace I met you for the first time? My mother brought me
      down, and I arrived with a strong prejudice against you, young lady,
      because of the clothes I'd been put into&mdash;they were fine but
      oppressive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long did the prejudice last, Charley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn't last at all, I thought you altogether the nicest little girl
      I'd ever seen&mdash;just what I think now, I wish you could care for me,
      Betty, just a little; just enough to marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Charley, I do care for you! I'm very, very fond of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't make such a merit of it,&rdquo; he said, and they both laughed.
      &ldquo;I'm at an awful disadvantage, Betty, from having proposed so often. That
      gives it a humorous touch which doesn't properly reflect the state of my
      feeling at all&mdash;and you hear me without the least emotion; so long as
      I keep my distance we might just as well be discussing the weather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good about that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keeping my distance, you mean?&mdash;Betty, if you knew how much
      resolution that calls for! I wonder if that isn't my mistake&mdash;&rdquo; And
      Norton came a step nearer and took her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her hands on his shoulders Betty pushed him back, while the rich
      color came into her cheeks. She was remembering Bruce Carrington, who had
      not kept his distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Charley,&rdquo; she said half angrily, &ldquo;I do like you tremendously, but
      I simply can't bear you when you act like this&mdash;let me go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty, I despair of you ever caring for me!&rdquo; and as Norton turned
      abruptly away he saw Tom Ware appear from about a corner of the house.
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it, there's Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very nice, anyway, Charley&mdash;&rdquo; said Betty hurriedly,
      fortified by the planter's approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ware stalked toward them. Having dined with Betty as recently as the day
      before, he contented himself with a nod in her direction. His greeting to
      Norton was a more ambitious undertaking; he said he was pleased to see
      him; but in so far as facial expression might have indorsed the statement
      this pleasure was well disguised, it did not get into his features.
      Pausing on the terrace beside them, he indulged in certain observations on
      the state of the crops and the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've lost a couple of niggers, I hear?&rdquo; he added with an oblique
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got on the track of them yet?&rdquo; Norton shook his head. &ldquo;I understand
      you've a new overseer?&rdquo; continued Ware, with another oblique glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you understand wrong&mdash;Carrington's my guest,&rdquo; said Norton.
      &ldquo;He's talking of putting in a crop for himself next season, so he's
      willing to help me make mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty turned quickly at the mention of Carrington's name. She had known
      that he was still at Thicket Point, and having heard him spoken of as
      Norton's new overseer, had meant to ask Charley if he were really filling
      that position. An undefined sense of relief came to her with Norton's
      reply to Tom's question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to turn farmer, is he?&rdquo; asked Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he says.&rdquo; Feeling that the only subjects in which he had ever known
      Ware to take the slightest interest, namely, crops and slaves, were
      exhausted, Norton was extremely disappointed when the planter manifested a
      disposition to play the host and returned to the house with them, where
      his mere presence, forbidding and sullen, was such a hardship that Norton
      shortly took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hang Tom!&rdquo; he said, as he rode away from Belle Plain. &ldquo;If he thinks
      he can freeze me out there's a long siege ahead of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Issuing from the lane he turned his face in the direction of home, but he
      did not urge his horse off a walk. To leave Belle Plain and Betty demanded
      always his utmost resolution. His way took him into the solemn twilight of
      untouched solitudes. A cool breath rippled through the depths of the woods
      and shaped its own soft harmonies where it lifted the great branches that
      arched the road. He crossed strips of bottom land where the water stood in
      still pools about the gnarled and moss-covered trunks of trees. At
      intervals down some sluggish inlet he caught sight of the yellow flood
      that was pouring past, or saw the Arkansas coast beyond, with its mighty
      sweep of unbroken forest that rose out of the river mists and blended with
      the gray distance that lay along the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was within two miles of Thicket Point when, passing about a sudden turn
      in the road, he found himself confronted by three men, and before he could
      gather up his reins which he held loosely, one of them had seized his
      horse by the bit. Norton was unarmed, he had not even a riding-whip. This
      being the case he prepared to make the best of an unpleasant situation
      which he felt he could not alter. He ran his eye over the three men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, gentlemen, but I reckon you have hold of the wrong person&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down!&rdquo; said one of the men briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any money, that's why I say you have hold of the wrong person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't want your money.&rdquo; The unexpectedness of this reply somewhat
      disturbed Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want, then?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got a word to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can hear it in the saddle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down!&rdquo; repeated the man, a surly, bull-necked fellow. &ldquo;Come&mdash;hurry
      up!&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norton hesitated for an instant, then swung himself out of the saddle and
      stood in the road confronting the spokesman of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what do you wish to say to me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this&mdash;you keep away from Belle Plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to hell!&rdquo; said Norton promptly. The man glowered heavily at hire
      through the gathering gloom of twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We want your word that you'll keep away from Belle Plain,&rdquo; he said with
      sullen insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you won't get it!&rdquo; responded Norton with quiet decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you won't!&rdquo; Norton's eyes began to flash. He wondered if these
      were Tom Ware's emissaries. He was both quick-tempered and high-spirited.
      Falling back a step, he sprang forward and dealt the bullnecked man a
      savage blow. The latter grunted heavily but kept his feet. In the same
      instant one of the men who had never taken his eyes off Norton from the
      moment he quitted the saddle, raised his fist and struck the young planter
      in the back of the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cur!&rdquo; cried Norton, blind and dizzy, as he wheeled on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn him&mdash;let him have it!&rdquo; roared the bullnecked man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward Norton was able to remember that the three rushed on him, that
      he was knocked down and kicked with merciless brutality, then
      consciousness left him. He lay very still in the trampled dust of the
      road. The bull-necked man regarded the limp figure in grim silence for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do, he's had enough; we ain't to kill him this time,&rdquo; he said. An
      instant later he, with his two companions, had vanished silently into the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norton's horse trotted down the road. When it entered the yard at Thicket
      Point half an hour later, Carrington was on the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Norton?&rdquo; he called, but there was no response, and he saw
      the horse was riderless. &ldquo;Jeff!&rdquo; he cried, summoning Norton's servant from
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Mas'r?&rdquo; asked the negro, as he appeared in the open
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, here's Mr. Norton's horse come home without him. Do you know where
      he went this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard him say he reckoned he'd ride over to Belle Plain, Mas'r,&rdquo;
       answered Jeff, grinning. &ldquo;I 'low the hoss done broke away and come home by
      himself&mdash;he couldn't a-throwed Mas'r Charley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll make sure of that. Get lanterns, and a couple of the boys!&rdquo; said
      Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was mid-afternoon of the day following before Betty heard of the attack
      on Charley Norton. Tom brought the news, and she at once ordered her horse
      saddled and was soon out on the river road with a black groom trailing
      along through the dust in her wake. Tom's version of the attack was that
      Charley, had been robbed and all but murdered, and Betty never drew rein
      until she reached Thicket Point. As she galloped into the yard Bruce
      Carrington came from the house. At sight of the girl, with her wind-blown
      halo of bright hair, he paused uncertainly. By a gesture Betty called him
      to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Mr. Norton?&rdquo; she asked, extending her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor says he'll be up and about inside of a week, anyhow, Miss
      Malroy,&rdquo; said Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty gave a great sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then his hurts are not serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carrington, &ldquo;they are not in any sense serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's pretty well bandaged up, so he looks worse off than he is. If you'll
      wait on the porch, I'll tell him you are here,&rdquo; for Betty had dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington passed on into the house. His face wore a look of somber
      repression. Of course it was all right for her to come and see Norton&mdash;they
      were old, old friends. He entered the room where Norton lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Malroy is here,&rdquo; he said shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty?&mdash;bless her dear heart!&rdquo; cried Charley rather weakly. &ldquo;Just
      toss my clothes into the closet and draw up a chair... There-thank you,
      Bruce, that will do&mdash;let her come along in now.&rdquo; And as Carrington
      quitted the room, Norton drew himself up on the pillows and faced the
      door. &ldquo;This is worth several beatings, Betty!&rdquo; he exclaimed as she
      appeared on the threshold. But much cotton and many bandages lent him a
      rather fearful aspect, and Betty paused with a little gasp of dismay. &ldquo;I'm
      lots better than I look, I expect,&rdquo; said Norton. &ldquo;Couldn't you arrange to
      come a little closer?&rdquo; he added, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent to kiss the hand she gave him, but groaned with the exertion. Then
      he looked up into her face and saw her eyes swimming with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;tears? Tears for me, Betty?&rdquo; and he was much moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a perfect outrage! Who did it, Charley?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sit down and I'll tell you all about it,&rdquo; said Norton happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me, Charley!&rdquo; when she had seated herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who fetched you, Betty&mdash;old Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I came alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's mighty kind of you. I'll be all right in a day or so. What did
      you hear?&mdash;that I'd been attacked and half-killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and robbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were three of the scoundrels. They made me climb out of the saddle,
      and as I was unarmed they did as they pleased with me, which was to stamp
      me flat in the road&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might almost be inclined to think they were friends of yours, Betty&mdash;or
      at least friends of friends of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Charley&mdash;friends of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see they started in by stipulating that I should keep away from
      Belle Plain, and the terms they proposed being on the face of them
      preposterous, trouble quickly ensued&mdash;trouble for me, you understand.
      But never mind, dear, the next man who undertakes to grab my horse by the
      bit won't get off quite so easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should any one care whether you come to Belle Plain or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if my amiable friend, Tom, could have arranged this little
      affair; it's sort of like old Tom to move in the dark, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn't&mdash;he wouldn't have done it, Charley!&rdquo; but she looked
      troubled, not too sure of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't he? Well, maybe he couldn't&mdash;but he's afraid you'll marry
      me&mdash;and I'm only afraid you won't. Betty, hasn't it ever seemed worth
      your while to marry me just to give old Tom the scare of his life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Charley&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in a dreadful state of mind when I think of you alone at Belle Plain&mdash;I
      wish you could love me, Betty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do love you. There is no one I care half so much for, Charley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norton shook his bandaged head and heaved a prodigious sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's merely saying you don't love any one.&rdquo; He dropped back rather
      wearily on his pillow. &ldquo;Does Tom know about this?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he able to show a proper amount of surprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appeared really shocked, Charley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, it wasn't Tom. He never shows much emotion, but what he does
      show he usually feels, I've noticed. I had rather hoped it was Tom, I'd be
      glad to think that he was responsible; for if it wasn't Tom, who was it?&mdash;who
      is it to whom it makes any difference how often I see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Charley;&rdquo; but her voice was uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Betty; for the hundredth time, won't you marry me? I've loved
      you ever since I was old enough to know what love meant. You've been
      awfully sweet and patient with me, and I've tried to respect your wishes
      and not speak of this except when it seemed necessary&mdash;&rdquo; he paused,
      and they both laughed a little, but he looked weak and helpless with his
      bloodless face showing between the gaps in the bandages that swathed him.
      Perhaps it was this sense of his helplessness that roused a feeling in
      Betty that was new to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Charley, I fear&mdash;I am sure I don't love you the way I
      should&mdash;to marry you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Charley, greatly excited, groaned and sat up, and groaned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please, Charley-lie still!&rdquo; she entreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right&mdash;and you needn't pull your hand away&mdash;you like
      me better than any one else, you've told me so; well, don't you see that's
      the beginning of really loving me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wouldn't want to marry me at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I would&mdash;right away&mdash;as soon as I am able to stir around!&rdquo;
       said Charley promptly. &ldquo;Don't you see the immediate necessity there is of
      my being in a position to care for you, Betty? I wasn't served this trick
      for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must try not to worry, Charley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall&mdash;I expect it's going to retard my recovery,&rdquo; said the
      young man gloomily. &ldquo;I couldn't be worse off! Here I am flat on my back; I
      can't come to you or keep watch over you. Let me have some hope, dear&mdash;let
      me believe that you will marry me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him pityingly, and with a certain latent tenderness in her
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really care so much for me, Charley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you, Betty!&mdash;I want you to say you will marry me as soon as I
      can stand by your side&mdash;you're not going?&mdash;I won't speak of this
      again if it annoys you, dear!&rdquo; for she had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must, Charley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't&mdash;well, then, if you will go, I want Carrington to ride
      back with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I brought George with me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, but I want you to take Carrington&mdash;the Lord knows what
      we are coming to here in West Tennessee; I must have word that you reach
      home safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, I'll ask Mr. Carrington. Good-by, Charley, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norton seemed to summon all his fortitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't have done a kinder thing than come here, Betty; I can't
      begin to tell you how grateful I am&mdash;and as for my loving you&mdash;why,
      I'll just keep on doing that to the end. I can see myself a bent, old man
      still pestering you with my attentions, and you a sweet, old lady with
      snow-white hair and pink cheeks, still obdurate&mdash;still saying no! Oh,
      Lord, isn't it awful!&rdquo; He had lifted himself on his elbow, and now sank
      back on his pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty paused irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you be happy without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't try to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use in my making any such foolish effort, I'd be doomed to failure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Charley&mdash;I really must go&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up yearningly into her face, and yielding to a sudden impulse,
      she stooped and kissed him on the forehead, then she fled from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come back&mdash;Betty&mdash;&rdquo; cried Norton, and his voice rose to a
      wail of entreaty, but she was gone. She had been quite as much surprised
      by her act as Charley himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the yard, Carrington was waiting for her. Jeff had just brought up
      Norton's horse, and though he made no display of weapons, the Kentuckian
      had fully armed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to ride to Belle Plain with you, Miss Malroy,&rdquo; he said, as he
      lifted her into her saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it necessary?&rdquo; she asked, but she did not look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not. I'll keep a bit in advance,&rdquo; he added, as he mounted his
      horse, and all Betty saw of him during their ride of five miles was his
      broad back. At the entrance to Belle Plain he reined in his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it's all right, now,&rdquo; he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will return at once to Mr. Norton?&rdquo; she asked. He nodded. &ldquo;And you
      will not leave him while he is helpless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll not leave him,&rdquo; said Carrington, giving her a steady glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad, I&mdash;his friends will feel so much safer with you there.
      I will send over in the morning to learn how he passed the night. Good-by,
      Mr. Carrington.&rdquo; And still refusing to meet his eyes, she gave him her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Carrington did not quit the mouth of the lane until she had crossed
      between the great fields of waving corn, and he had seen her pass up the
      hillside beyond to the oak grove, where the four massive chimneys of Belle
      Plain house showed their gray stone copings among the foliage. With this
      last glimpse of her he turned away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. THICKET POINT
    </h2>
    <p>
      It WAS a point with Mr. Ware to see just as little as possible of Betty.
      He had no taste for what he called female chatter. A sane interest in the
      price of cotton or pork he considered the only rational test of human
      intelligence, and Betty evinced entire indifference where those great
      staples were concerned, hence it was agreeable to him to have most of his
      meals served in his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Betty had sought to adapt herself to his somewhat peculiar scheme
      of life, but Tom had begged her not to regard him, his movements from hour
      to hour were cloaked in uncertainty. The man who had to overlook the labor
      of eighty or ninety field hands was the worst sort of a slave himself; the
      niggers knew when they could sit down to a meal; he never did.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for all his avoidance of Betty, he in reality kept the closest kind of
      a watch on her movements, and when he learned that she had visited Charley
      Norton&mdash;George, the groom, was the channel through which this
      information reached him&mdash;he was both scandalized and disturbed. He
      felt the situation demanded some sort of a protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it just hell the way a woman can worry you?&rdquo; he lamented, as he
      hurried up the path from the barns to the house. He found Betty at supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I'd have a cup of tea with you, Bet&mdash;what else have you
      that's good?&rdquo; he inquired genially, as he dropped into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was nice of you; we don't see very much of each other, do we, Tom?&rdquo;
       said Betty pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ware twisted his features, on which middle age had rested an untender
      hand, into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man undertakes to manage a place like Belle Plain his work's laid
      out for him, Betty, and an old fellow like me is pretty apt to go one of
      two ways; either he takes to hard living to keep himself in trim, or he
      pampers himself soft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you aren't old, Tom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were sure of seeing forty-five or even forty-eight again&mdash;but
      I'm not,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that isn't really old,&rdquo; objected Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's old enough, Bet, as you'll discover for yourself one of
      these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, Tom!&rdquo; cried Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ware consumed a cup of tea in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were over to see Norton, weren't you, Bet? How did you find him?&rdquo; he
      asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor says he will soon be about again,&rdquo; answered Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom stroked his chin and gazed at her reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty, I wish you wouldn't go there again&mdash;that's a good girl!&rdquo; he
      said tactfully, and as he conceived it, affectionately, even, paving the
      way for an exercise of whatever influence might be his, a point on which
      he had no very clear idea. Betty glanced up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Tom, why shouldn't I go there?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might set people gossiping. I reckon there's been pretty near enough
      talk about you and Charley Norton. A young girl can't be too careful.&rdquo; The
      planter's tone was conciliatory in the extreme, he dared not risk a break
      by any open show of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't distress yourself, Tom. I don't know that I shall go there
      again,&rdquo; said Betty indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't if I were you.&rdquo; He was charmed to find her so reasonable. &ldquo;You
      know it isn't the thing for a young girl to call on a man, you'll get
      yourself talked about in a way you won't like&mdash;take my word for it!
      If you want to be kind and neighborly send one of the boys over to ask how
      he is&mdash;or bake a cake with your own hands, but you keep away. That's
      the idea!&mdash;send him something to eat, something you've made yourself,
      he'll appreciate that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid he couldn't eat it if I did, Tom. It's plain you have no
      acquaintance with my cooking,&rdquo; said Betty, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Norton say if he had any idea as to the identity of the men who
      robbed him?&rdquo; inquired Tom casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their object wasn't robbery,&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; Ware's glance was uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that some one objects to his coming here, Tom&mdash;here to
      Belle Plain to see me, I suppose,&rdquo; added Betty. The planter moved
      uncomfortably in his seat, refusing to meet her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shouldn't put out a yarn like that, Bet. It isn't just the thing for a
      gentleman to do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't putting it out, as you call it! He has told no one, so far as I
      know,&rdquo; said Betty quickly. Mr. Ware fell into a brooding silence. &ldquo;Of
      course, Charley wouldn't mention my name in any such connection!&rdquo;
       continued Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares how often he comes here? You don't, and I don't. There's more
      back of this than Charley would want you to know. I reckon he's got his
      enemies; some one's had a grudge against him and taken this way to settle
      it.&rdquo; The planter's tone and manner were charged with an unpleasant
      significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like your hints, Tom,&rdquo; said Betty. Her heightened color and the
      light in her eyes warned Tom that he had said enough. In some haste he
      finished his second cup of tea, a beverage which he despised, and after a
      desultory remark or two, withdrew to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty went up-stairs to her own room, where she tried to finish a letter
      she had begun the day before to Judith Ferris, but she was in no mood for
      this. She was owning to a sense of utter depression and she had been at
      home less than a month. Struggle as she might against the feeling, it was
      borne in upon her that she was wretchedly lonely. She had seated herself
      by an open window. Now, resting her elbows on the ledge and with her chin
      between her palms, she gazed off into the still night. A mile distant, on
      what was called &ldquo;Shanty Hill,&rdquo; were the quarters of the slaves. The only
      lights she saw were there, the only sounds she heard reached her across
      the intervening fields. This was her world. A half-savage world with its
      uncouth army of black dependents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom's words still rankled. Betty's temper flared up belligerently as she
      recalled them. He had evidently meant to insinuate that Charley had lied
      outright when he told her the motive for the attack, and he had followed
      it up by that covert slur on his character. Charley's devotion was the
      thing that redeemed the dull monotony of existence. She became suddenly
      humble and tenderly penitent in her mood toward him; he loved her much
      better than she deserved, and she suspected that her own attitude had been
      habitually ungenerous and selfish. She had accepted all and yielded
      nothing. She wondered gravely why it was she did not love him; she was
      fond of him&mdash;she was very, very fond of him; she wondered if after
      all, as he said, this were not the beginning of love, the beginning of
      that deeper feeling which she was not sure she understood, not sure she
      should ever experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of Charley's unwavering affection gave her a great sense of
      peace; it was something to have inspired such devotion, she could never be
      quite desperate while she had him. She must try to make him understand how
      possible an ideal friendship was between them, how utterly impossible
      anything else. She would like to have seen Charley happily married to some
      nice girl&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder whom!&rdquo; thought Betty, gazing deep into the night
      through her drooping lashes. She considered possible candidates for the
      happiness she herself seemed so willing to forego, but for one reason or
      another dismissed them all. &ldquo;I am not sure I should care to see him
      marry,&rdquo; she confessed under her breath. &ldquo;It would spoil everything. Men
      are much nicer than girls!&rdquo; And Charley possessed distinguished merits as
      a man; he was not to be too hastily disposed of, even for his own good.
      She viewed him in his various aspects, his character and disposition came
      under her critical survey. Nature had given the young planter a handsome
      presence; wealth and position had come to him as fortuitously. The first
      of these was no great matter, perhaps; Betty herself was sometimes
      burdened with a sense of possession, but family was indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In theory, at least, she was a thoroughgoing little aristocrat. A
      gentleman was always a gentleman. There were exceptions, like Tom, to be
      sure, but even Tom could have reached up and seized the title had he
      coveted it. She rarely forgot that she was the mistress of Belle Plain and
      a Malroy. Just wherein a Malroy differed from the rest of the sons of men
      she had never paused to consider, it sufficed that there was a hazy Malroy
      genealogy that went back to tidewater Virginia, and then if one were not
      meanly curious, and would skip a generation or two that could not be
      accounted for in ways any Malroy would accept, one might triumphantly
      follow the family to a red-roofed Sussex manor house. Altogether, it was a
      highly satisfactory genealogy and it had Betty's entire faith. The Nortons
      were every bit as good as the Malroys, which was saying a great deal.
      Their history was quite as pretentious, quite as vague, and as hopelessly
      involved in the mists of tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inexplicably enough, Betty found that her thoughts had wandered to
      Carrington; which was very singular, as she had long since formed a
      resolution not to think of him at all. Yet she remembered with
      satisfaction his manner that afternoon, it left nothing to be desired. He
      was probably understanding the impassable gulf that separated them&mdash;education,
      experience, feeling, everything that made up the substance of life but
      deepened and widened this gulf. He belonged to that shifting, adventurous
      population which was far beneath the slave-holding aristocracy, at least
      he more nearly belonged to this lower order than to any other. She fixed
      his status relentlessly as something to be remembered when they should
      meet again. At last, with a little puckering of the brows and a firm
      contraction of the lips, she dismissed the Kentuckian from her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty complied with Tom's expressed wish, for she did not again visit
      Thicket Point, but then she had not intended doing so. However, the
      planter was greatly shocked by the discovery he presently made that she
      was engaged in a vigorous correspondence with Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to blazes Murrell had told those fellows to kick the life clean
      out of him while they were about it!&rdquo; he commented savagely, and fell to
      cursing impotently. Brute force was a factor to be introduced with caution
      into the affairs of life, but if you were going to use it, his belief was
      that you should use it to the limit. You couldn't scare Norton, he was in
      love with that pink-faced little fool. Keep away?&mdash;he'd never think
      of it, he'd stuff his pockets full of pistols and the next man who stopped
      him on the road would better look out! It made him sick&mdash;the utter
      lack of sense manifested by Murrell, and his talk, whenever they met, was
      still of the girl. He couldn't see anything so damn uncommon about that
      red-and-white chit. She wasn't worth running your neck into a halter for&mdash;no
      woman that ever lived was worth that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The correspondence, so far as Betty was responsible for it, bore just on
      one point. She wanted Charley to promise that for a time, at least, he
      would not attempt to see her. It seemed such a needless risk to take,
      couldn't he be satisfied if he heard from her every day?
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley was regretful, but firm. Just as soon as he could mount his horse
      he would ride down to Belle Plain. She was not to distress herself on his
      account; he had been surprised, but this should not happen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm manner in which he put aside her fears for his safety exasperated
      Betty beyond measure. She scolded him vigorously. Charley accepted the
      scolding with humility, but his resolution was unshaken; he did not
      propose to vacate the public roads at any man's behest; that would be an
      unwise precedent to establish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty replied that this was not a matter in which silly vanity should
      enter, even if his life was of no value to himself it did not follow that
      she held it lightly. It required some eight closely written pages for
      Charley to explain why existence would be an unsupportable burden if he
      were denied the sight of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week had intervened since the attack, and from Jeff, who always brought
      Charley's letters, Betty learned more of Charley's condition than Charley
      himself had seen fit to tell. According to Jeff his master was now able to
      get around pretty tolerable well, though he had a powerful keen misery in
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was whar' they done kicked him most, Miss,&rdquo; he added. Betty
      shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much longer will he be confined to the house?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard him 'low to Mas'r Carrington, Miss, as how he reckoned he'd take
      a hossback ride to-morrow evenin' if the black and blue was all come out
      of his features&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rdquo; gasped Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems like they was mighty careless whar' they put their feet, don't it,
      Miss?&rdquo; said Jeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this information she gleaned from Jeff that led Betty to desperate
      lengths, to the making of what her cooler judgment told her was a
      desperate bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Thicket Point Charley Norton, greatly excited, hobbled into the library
      in search of Carrington. He found him reading by the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Bruce!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It's settled; she's going to marry me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book slipped unheeded from Carrington's hand to the floor. For a
      moment he sat motionless, then he slowly pulled himself up out of his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; he asked a trifle thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty Malroy is going to marry me,&rdquo; said Norton. Carrington gazed at him
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's settled, is it?&rdquo; he asked at length. He saw his own hopes go down in
      miserable wreck; they had been utterly futile from the first. He had known
      all along that Norton loved her, the young planter had made no secret of
      it. He had been less frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear you take it quietly enough,&rdquo; said Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you wish me joy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to take any risks now, you have too much to live for,&rdquo;
       he said haltingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm to keep away from Belle Plain,&rdquo; said Norton happily. &ldquo;She insists
      on that; she says she won't even see me if I come there. Everything is to
      be kept a secret; nothing's to be known until we are actually married;
      it's her wish&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's to be soon then?&rdquo; Carrington asked, still haltingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief silence. Carrington, with face averted, looked from the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to stay here as long as you need me,&rdquo; he presently said. &ldquo;She&mdash;Miss
      Malroy asked me to, and then I am going back to the river where I belong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Norton turned on him quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean you've abandoned the notion of turning planter?&rdquo; he
      demanded in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes. What's the use of my trying my hand at a business I don't know
      the first thing about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be in too big a hurry to decide finally on that point,&rdquo; urged
      Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has decided itself,&rdquo; said Carrington quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Norton was conscious of a subtle change in their relation. Carrington
      seemed a shade less frank than had been habitual with him; all at once he
      had removed his private affairs from the field of discussion. Afterward,
      when Norton considered the matter, he wondered if it were not that the
      Kentuckian felt himself superfluous in this new situation that had grown
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley Norton's features recovered their accustomed hue, but he did not
      go near Belle Plain; with resolute fortitude he confined himself to his
      own acres. He was tolerably familiar with certain engaging little
      peculiarities of Mr. Ware's; he knew, for instance, that the latter was a
      gentleman of excessively regular habits; once each fortnight, making an
      excuse of business, he spent a day in Memphis, neither more nor less.
      Norton told himself with satisfaction that Tom was destined to return to
      the surprise of his life from the next of these trips. This conviction was
      the one thing which sustained Charley for some ten days. They were
      altogether the longest ten days he had ever known, and he had about
      reached the limit of his endurance when Betty's groom arrived with a
      letter which threw him into a state of ecstatic happiness. The
      sober-minded Tom would devote the morrow to Memphis and business. This
      meant that he would leave Belle Plain at sun-up and return after
      nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may not like Tom, but you can always count on him,&rdquo; said Norton. Then
      he ordered his horse and rode off in the direction of Raleigh, but before
      leaving the house, he scribbled a line or two to be handed Carrington, who
      had gone down to the nearest river landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nightfall when the Kentuckian returned, Hearing his step in the
      hall, Jeff came from the dining-room, where he was laying the cloth for
      supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mas'r Charley has rid to Raleigh, Sah,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but he done lef' this
      fo' me to han' to yo&rdquo;&mdash;extending the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington took it. He guessed its contents. Breaking the seal he read the
      half dozen lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;&rdquo; he muttered under his breath, and slowly tore the sheet
      of note-paper into thin ribbons. He turned to Jeff. &ldquo;Mr. Charley won't be
      home until late,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I 'low yo' want yo' supper now, Sar?&rdquo; But Carrington shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you needn't bother, Jeff,&rdquo; he said, as he turned toward the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later and he had got together his belongings and was ready to
      quit Thicket Point. He retraced his steps to the floor below. In the hall
      he paused and glanced about him. He seemed to feel her presence&mdash;and
      very near&mdash;to-morrow she would enter there as Norton's wife. With his
      pack under his arm he entered the dining-room in search of Jeff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell your master I have gone to Memphis,&rdquo; he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't yo' goin' to have a hoss, Mas'r Carrington?&rdquo; demanded Jeff in some
      surprise. He had come to regard the Kentuckian as a fixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carrington. &ldquo;Good-by, Jeff,&rdquo; he added, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he left Thicket Point he did not take the Memphis road, but the
      road to Belle Plain. Walking rapidly, he reached the entrance to the lane
      within the hour. Here he paused irresolutely, it was as if the force of
      his purpose had already spent itself. Then he tossed his pack into a fence
      corner and kept on toward the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII. AT THE CHURCH DOOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was the patter of small feet beyond Betty's door, and little Steve,
      who looked more like a nice fat black Cupid than anything else, rapped
      softly; at the same time he effected to squint through the keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper served, Missy,&rdquo; he announced, then he turned no less than seven
      handsprings in the upper hall and slid down the balustrade to the floor
      below. He was far from being a model house servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      His descent was witnessed by the butler. Now in his own youth big Steve
      with as fair a field had cut similar capers, yet he was impelled by his
      sense of duty to do for his grandson what his own father had so often done
      for him, and in no perfunctory manner. It was only the sound of Betty's
      door opening and closing that stayed his hand as he was making choice of a
      soft and vulnerable spot to which he should apply it. Little Steve slid
      under the outstretched arm that menaced him and fled to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty came slowly down the stairs. Four hours since Jeff had ridden away
      with the letter. Already there had come to her moments when, she would
      have given much could she have recalled it, when she knew with dread
      certainty that whatever her feeling for Charley, it was not love; moments
      when she realized that she had been cruelly driven by circumstances into a
      situation that offered no escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mas'r Tom he say he won't come in to supper, Missy; he 'low he's powerful
      busy, gittin' ready to go to Memphis in the mo'ning,&rdquo; explained Steve, as
      he followed Betty into the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mistress nodded indifferently as she seated herself at the table; she
      was glad to be alone just then; she was in no mood to carry on the usual
      sluggish conversation with Tom; her own thoughts absorbed her more and
      more they became terrifying things to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ate her supper with big Steve standing behind her chair and little
      Steve balancing himself first on one foot and then on the other near the
      door. Little Steve's head was on a level with the chair rail and but for
      the rolling whites of his eyes he was no more than a black shadow against
      the walnut wainscoting; he formed the connecting link between the
      dining-room and the remote kitchen. Betty suspected that most of the
      platters journeyed down the long corridor deftly perched on top of his
      woolly head. She frequently detected him with greasy or sticky fingers,
      which while it argued a serious breach of trust also served to indicate
      his favorite dishes. These two servitors were aware that their mistress
      was laboring under some unusual stress of emotion. In its presence big
      Steven, who, with the slightest encouragement, became a medium through
      which the odds and ends of plantation gossip reached Betty's ears, held
      himself to silence; while little Steve ceased to shift his weight from
      foot to foot, the very dearth of speech fixed his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long French windows, their curtains drawn, stood open. All day a hot
      September sun had beaten upon the earth, but with the fall of twilight a
      soft wind had sprung up and the candles in their sconces flared at its
      touch. It came out of wide solitudes laden with the familiar night sounds.
      It gave Betty a sense of vast unused spaces, of Belle Plain clinging on
      the edge of an engulfing wilderness, of her own loneliness. She needed
      Charley as much as he seemed to think he needed her. The life she had been
      living had become suddenly impossible of continuance; that it had ever
      been possible was because of Charley; she knew this now as she had never
      known it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thoughts dealt with the past. In her one great grief, her mother's
      death, it had been Charley who had sustained and comforted her. She was
      conscious of a choking sense of gratitude as she recalled his patient
      tenderness at that time, the sympathy and understanding he had shown; it
      was something never to be forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unrest presently sent her from the house. She wandered down to the
      terrace. Before her was the wide sweep of the swampy fore-shore, and
      beyond just beginning to silver in the moonlight, the bend of the river
      growing out of the black void. With her eyes on the river and her hands
      clasped loosely she watched the distant line of the Arkansas coast grow up
      against the sky; she realized that the moon was rising on Betty Malroy for
      the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She liked Charley; she needed some one to take care of her and her
      belongings, and he needed her. It was best for them both that she should
      marry him. True she might have gone back to Judith Ferris; that would have
      been one solution of her difficulties. Why hadn't she thought of doing
      this before? Of course, Charley would have followed her East. Charley met
      the ordinary duties and responsibilities of his position somewhat
      recklessly; it was only where she was concerned that he became patiently
      determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the end would have been the same there as here,&rdquo; thought Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she found herself wondering if Charley had told Carrington
      yet; certainly the Kentuckian would not remain at Thicket Point when he
      knew. She was sure she wished him to leave not Thicket Point merely, but
      the neighborhood. She did not wish to see him again&mdash;not see him
      again&mdash;not see him again&mdash;She found herself repeating the words
      over and over; they shaped themselves into a dreadful refrain. A nameless
      terror of the future swept in upon her. She was cold and sick. It was as
      though an icy hand was laid upon her heart. The words ran on in endless
      repetition&mdash;not see him again&mdash;they held the very soul of
      tragedy for her, yet she was roused to passionate protest. She must not
      think of him, he was nothing to her. She was to be married to another man,
      even now she was almost a wife&mdash;but battle as she might the struggle
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of a step on the path. Betty turned, supposing it to
      be Tom; but it was not Tom, it was Carrington himself who stood before
      her, his face haggard and drawn. She uttered an involuntary exclamation
      and shrank away from him. Without a word he stepped to her side and took
      her hands rather roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was silence between them, Betty stared up into his face
      with wide scared eyes, while he gazed down at her as if he would fasten
      something on his mind that must never be forgotten. Suddenly he lifted her
      soft cold hands to his lips and kissed them passionately again and again;
      then he held them in his own against his cheek, his glance still fixed
      intently upon her; it held something of bitterness and reproach, but now
      she kept her eyes under their quivering lids from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I to do without you?&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was almost a whisper. &ldquo;What
      is this thing you have done?&rdquo; Betty's heart was beating with dull
      sickening throbs, but she dared not trust herself to answer him. He took
      both her hands in one of his, and, slipping the other under her chin,
      raised her face so that he could look into her eyes; then he put his arm
      loosely about her, holding her hands against his breast. &ldquo;If I could have
      had one moment out of all the years for my own&mdash;only one. I am glad
      you don't care, dear; it hurts when you reach the end of something that
      has been all your hope and filled all your days. I have come to say
      good-by, Betty; this is the last time I shall see you. I am going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All in an instant Betty pressed close to him, hiding her face in his arm;
      she clung to him in a panic of pain and horror. She felt something stir
      within her that had never been there before, as a storm of passionate
      longing swept through her. Her words, her promise to another man, became
      as nothing. All her pride was forgotten. Without this man the days
      stretched away before her a blank. His arm drew her closer still, until
      she felt her heart throb against his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care?&rdquo; he said, and seemed to wonder that she should.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bruce, Bruce, I didn't know&mdash;and now&mdash;Oh, my dear, my dear&mdash;&rdquo;
       He pressed his lips against the bright little head that rested in such
      miserable abandon against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; he whispered. The blood ran riot in his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you stayed away&mdash;why didn't you come to me? I have promised
      him&mdash;&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, and shut his lips. There was another silence while she
      waited for him to speak. She felt that she was at his mercy, that whether
      right or wrong, as he decided so it would be. At length he said. &ldquo;I
      thought it wasn't fair to him, and it seemed so hopeless after I came
      here. I had nothing&mdash;and a man feels that&mdash;so I kept away.&rdquo; He
      spoke awkwardly with something of the reserve that was habitual to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had only come!&rdquo; she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did&mdash;once,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't understand; why did you believe anything I said to you? It was
      only that I cared&mdash;that in my heart I knew I cared&mdash;I've cared
      about you ever since that trip down the river, and now I am going to be
      married to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow, Bruce&mdash;do you realize I have given
      my promise? I am to meet him at the Spring Bank church at ten o'clock&mdash;and
      it's tomorrow!&rdquo; she cried, in a laboring choked voice. For answer he drew
      her closer. &ldquo;Bruce, what can I do?&mdash;tell me what I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington made an involuntary gesture of protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you that, dear&mdash;for I don't know.&rdquo; His voice was
      steady, but it came from lips that quivered. He knew that he might have
      urged the supreme claim of his love and in her present desperate mood she
      would have listened, but the memory of Norton would have been between them
      always a shame and reproach; as surely as he stood there with his arms
      about her, as surely as she clung to him so warm and near, he would have
      lived to see the shadow of that shame in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can not do it&mdash;I can not, Bruce!&rdquo; she panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear&mdash;dear&mdash;don't tempt me!&rdquo; He held himself in check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to tell you&mdash;just this once, Bruce&mdash;I love you&mdash;you
      are my own for this one moment out of my life!&rdquo; and she abandoned herself
      to the passionate caressing with which he answered her. &ldquo;How can I give
      you up?&rdquo; he said, his voice hoarse with emotion. He put her from him
      almost roughly, and leaning against the trunk of a tree buried his face in
      his hands. Betty watched him for a moment in wretched silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't feel so bad, Bruce,&rdquo; she said brokenly. &ldquo;I am not worth it. I tried
      not to love you&mdash;I didn't want to.&rdquo; She raised a white face to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going now, Betty. You&mdash;you shouldn't stay here any longer with
      me.&rdquo; He spoke with sudden resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I shall not see you again?&rdquo; she asked, in a low, stifled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's good-by&mdash;&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet&mdash;oh, not yet, Bruce&mdash;&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;I can not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;now, dear. I don't dare stay&mdash;I may forget&mdash;&rdquo; but he
      turned again to her in entreaty. &ldquo;Give me something to remember in all the
      years that are coming when I shall be alone&mdash;let me kiss you on the
      lips&mdash;let me&mdash;just this once&mdash;it's good-by we're saying&mdash;it's
      good-by, Betty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to him, and, as he bent above her, slipped her arms about his
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me&mdash;&rdquo; she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her hair, her soft cheek, then their lips met.
    </p>
    <p>
      He helped her as she stumbled blindly along the path to the house, and
      half lifted her up the steps to the door. They paused there for a moment.
      At last he turned from her abruptly in silence. A step away he halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you should ever need me&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Never as now,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw his tall figure pass down the path, and her straining eyes
      followed until it was lost in the mild wide spaces of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hot September sun was beating upon the earth as Betty galloped
      down the lane and swung her horse's head in the direction of Raleigh. Her
      grief had worn itself out and she carried a pale but resolute face.
      Carrington was gone; she would keep her promise to Charley and he should
      never know what his happiness had cost her. She nerved herself for their
      meeting; somewhere between Belle Plain and Thicket Point Norton would be
      waiting for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He joined her before she had covered a third of the distance that
      separated the two plantations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, my darling!&rdquo; he cried fervently, as he ranged up alongside of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you weren't sure of me, Charley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wasn't sure, Betty&mdash;but I hoped. I have been haunting the road
      for more than an hour. You are making one poor unworthy devil happy,
      unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless what, Charley?&rdquo; she prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you came here merely to tell me that after all you couldn't marry
      me.&rdquo; He put out his hand and covered hers that held the reins. &ldquo;I'll never
      give you cause to regret it&mdash;you know how I love you, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Charley&mdash;I know.&rdquo; She met his glance bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to go to the church. Mr. Bowen will be there; I arranged with him
      last night; he will drive over with his wife and daughter, who will be our
      witnesses, dear. We could have gone to his house, but I thought it would
      seem more like a real wedding in a church, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty did not answer him, her eyes were fixed straight ahead, the last
      vestige of color had faded from her face and a deathly pallor was there.
      This was the crowning horror. She felt the terrible injustice she was
      doing the man at her side, the depth and sincerity of his devotion was
      something for which she could make no return. Her lips trembled on the
      verge of an avowal of her love for Carrington. Presently she saw the
      church in its grove of oaks, in the shade of one of these stood Mr.
      Bowen's horse and buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't have to wait on him!&rdquo; said Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;&rdquo; Betty gasped out the monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;my darling&mdash;what's the matter?&rdquo; he asked tenderly, his
      glance bent in concern on the frightened face of the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing, Charley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reined in their horses. Norton sprang to the ground and lifted
      her from the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will only take a moment, dear!&rdquo; he whispered encouragingly in the
      brief instant he held her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Charley, it isn't that&mdash;it's dreadfully serious&mdash;&rdquo; she
      said, with a wild little laugh that was almost hysterical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't have it less than that,&rdquo; he said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward Betty could remember standing before the church in the fierce
      morning light; she heard Mr. Bowen's voice, she heard Charley's voice, she
      heard another voice&mdash;her own, though she scarcely recognized it.
      Then, like one aroused from a dream, she looked about her&mdash;she met
      Charley's glance; his face was radiant and she smiled back at him through
      a sudden mist that swam before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowen led her toward the church door. As they neared it they caught
      the clatter of hoofs, and Tom Ware on a hard-ridden horse dashed up; he
      was covered with dust and inarticulate with rage. Then a cry came from him
      that was like the roar of some mortally wounded animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid this marriage!&rdquo; he shrieked, when he could command speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're too late to stop it, Tom, but you can attend it,&rdquo; said Norton
      composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; Words failed the planter; he sat his horse the
      picture of a grim and sordid despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowen divided a look of reproach between his wife and daughter; his
      own conscience was clear; he had told no one of the purpose of Norton's
      call the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tie the horses, Betty,&rdquo; said Norton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ware turned fiercely to Bowen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew better than to be a party to this, and by God!&mdash;if you go
      on with it you shall live to regret it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister made him no answer, he thoroughly disapproved of the planter.
      It was well that Betty should have a proper protector, this half-brother
      was hardly that measured by any standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norton, leading the horses, had reached the edge of the oaks when from the
      silent depths of the denser woods came the sharp report of a rifle. The
      shock of the bullet sent the young fellow staggering back among the mossy
      and myrtle-covered graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment no one grasped what had happened, only there was Norton who
      seemed to grope strangely among the graves. Black spots danced before his
      eyes, the little group by the church merged into the distance&mdash;always
      receding, always more remote, as he, stumbled helplessly over the moss and
      the thick dank myrtle and among the round graves that gave him a
      treacherous footing; and then he heard Betty's agonized cry. He had fallen
      now, and his strength went from him, but he kept his face turned on the
      group before the church in mute appeal, and even as the shadows deepened
      he was aware that Betty was coming swiftly toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm shot&mdash;&rdquo; he said, speaking with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charley&mdash;Charley&mdash;&rdquo; she moaned, slipping her strong young arms
      about him and gathering him to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over&mdash;&rdquo; he said, but as much in wonder as in fear. &ldquo;But I
      knew you would come to me&mdash;dear&mdash;&rdquo; he added in a whisper. She
      felt a shudder pass through him. He did not speak again. His lips opened
      once, and closed on silence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. THE JUDGE OFFERS A REWARD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The news of Charley Norton's murder spread quickly over the county. For
      two or three days bands of armed men scoured the woods and roads, and then
      this activity quite unproductive of any tangible results ceased, matters
      were allowed to rest with the constituted authorities, namely Mr. Betts
      the sheriff, and his deputies.
    </p>
    <p>
      No private citizen had shown greater zeal than Judge Slocum Price, no
      voice had clamored more eloquently for speedy justice than his. He had
      sustained a loss that was in a peculiar sense personal, he explained. Mr.
      Norton was his friend and client; they had much in common; their political
      ideals were in the strictest accord and he had entertained a most
      favorable opinion of the young man's abilities; he had urged him to enter
      the national arena and carve out a career for himself; he had promised him
      his support. The judge so worked upon his own feelings that presently any
      mention of Norton's name utterly unmanned him. Well, this was life. One
      could only claim time as it was doled out by clock ticks; we planned for
      the years and could not be certain of the moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent two entire days at the church and in the surrounding woods, nor
      did any one describe the murder with the vividness he achieved in his
      description of it. The minister's narrative was pale and colorless by
      comparison, and those who came from a distance went away convinced that
      they had talked with an eyewitness to the tragedy and esteemed themselves
      fortunate. In short, he imposed himself on the situation with such
      brilliancy that in the end his account of the murder became the accepted
      version from which all other versions differed to their discredit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same magnificent spirit of public service he would have assumed the
      direction of the search for the murderer, but Mr. Betts' jealousy proved
      an obstacle to his ambitious design. In view of this he was regretful, but
      not surprised when the hard-ridden miles covered by dusty men and reeking
      horses yielded only failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had shot that poor boy, I wouldn't ask any surer guarantee of safety
      than to have that fool Betts with his microscopic brain working in
      unhampered asininity on the case,&rdquo; he told Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your idea that you are enlarging your circle of intimate friends by
      the way you go about slamming into folks?&rdquo; inquired Mahaffy, with harsh
      sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, the judge was shocked at what he characterized as official apathy.
      It became a point on which he expressed himself with surpassing candor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they think the murderer's going to come in and give himself up?&mdash;is
      that the notion?&rdquo; he demanded heatedly of Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sheriff owns himself beat, Sir; the murderer's got safely away and
      left no clue to his identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge waived this aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clues, sir? If you mean physical evidence the eye can apprehend, I grant
      it; the murderer has got away; certainly he's been given all the time he
      needed, but what about the motive that prompted the crime? An
      intelligently conducted examination such as I am willing to undertake
      might still bring it to light. Isn't it known that Norton was attacked a
      fortnight ago as he was leaving Belle Plain? He recovers and is about to
      be married to Miss Malroy when he is shot at the church door; I'll hazard
      the opinion the attack was in the nature of a warning for him to keep away
      from Belle Plain. Now, had he a rival? Clear up these points and you get a
      clue!&rdquo; The judge paused impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Ware has acted in a straightforward manner. He's stated frankly he
      was opposed to the match, that when he heard about it on his way to
      Memphis he turned back and made every effort to get to the church in time
      to stop it if he could,&rdquo; said Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Ware need not be considered,&rdquo; observed the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's been a heap of talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he'd inspired the firing of the fatal shot he'd have kept away from
      the church. No, no, Mr. Saul, is there anybody hereabout who aspired to
      Miss Malroy's hand&mdash;any rejected suitor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that we know of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under ordinary circumstances, sir, I am opposed to measures that ignore
      the constituted authorities, but we find ourselves living under
      extraordinary conditions, and the law&mdash;God save the name&mdash;has
      proved itself abortive. It is time for the better element to join bands;
      we must get together, sir. I am willing to take the initial steps and
      issue the call for a mass meeting of our best citizens. I am prepared to
      address such a meeting.&rdquo; The very splendor of his conception dazzled the
      judge; this promised a gorgeous publicity with his name flying broadcast
      over the county. He continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready to give my time gratuitously to directing the activities of a
      body of picked men who shall rid the county of the lawless element. God
      knows, sir, I desire the repose of a private career, yet I am willing to
      sacrifice myself. Is it your opinion, Mr. Saul, that I should move in this
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you didn't,&rdquo; said Mr. Saul, with disappointing alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge looked at him fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I wrong in supposing, Mr. Saul, that if I determine to act as I have
      outlined I shall have your indorsement?&rdquo; he demanded. Mr. Saul looked
      extremely uncomfortable; he was finding the judge's effulgent personality
      rather compelling. &ldquo;There is no gentleman whose support I should value in
      quite the same sense that I should value yours, Mr. Saul; I should like to
      feel my course met with your full approval,&rdquo; pursued the judge, with
      charming deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get yourself shot full of holes,&rdquo; said Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What causes me to hesitate is this: my name is unfamiliar to your
      citizens. You know their prejudices, Mr. Saul; how would they regard me if
      I put myself forward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say how they would take it,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the judge gave him a fixed scrutiny. Then ha shook him warmly by the
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of what I have said; ponder it, sir, and let me have your answer at
      another time.&rdquo; And he backed from Mr. Saul's presence with spectacular
      politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cheap mind!&rdquo; thought the judge, as he hurried up the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broached the subject to Mr. Wesley the postmaster, to Mr. Ellison the
      gunsmith, to Mr. Pegloe, employing much the same formula he had used with
      Mr. Saul, and with results almost identical. He imagined there must be
      some conspiracy afoot to keep him out of the public eye, and in the end he
      managed to lose his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't Norton any friends?&rdquo; he demanded of Pegloe. &ldquo;Who's going to be
      safe at this rate? We want to let some law into west Tennessee, a hanging
      or two would clear the air!&rdquo; His emotions became a rage that blew through
      him like a gale, shaking him to his center.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two mornings later he found where it had been placed under his door during
      the night a folded paper. It contained a single line of writing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk too much. Shut up, or you'll go where Norton went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the judge was accessible to certain forms of fear. He was, for
      instance, afraid of snakes&mdash;both kinds&mdash;and mobs he had dreaded
      desperately since his Pleasantville experience; but beyond this, fear
      remained an unexplored region to Slocum Price, and as he examined the
      scrawl a smile betokening supreme satisfaction overspread his battered
      features. He was agreeably affected by the situation; indeed he was
      delighted. His activities were being recognized; he had made his
      impression; the cutthroats had selected him to threaten. Well, the damned
      rascals showed their good sense; he'd grant them that! Swelling with
      pride, he carried the scrawl to Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are forming their estimate of me, Solomon; I shall have them on the
      run yet!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going out of your way to hunt trouble&mdash;as if you hadn't
      enough at the best of times, Price! Let these people manage their own
      affairs, don't you mix up in them,&rdquo; advised the conservative Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge drew himself up with an air of lofty pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I am going to be silenced, intimidated, by this sort of
      thing? No, sir! No, Solomon, the stopper isn't made that will fit my
      mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later he burst in on Mr. Saul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glance at that, my friend!&rdquo; he cried, as he tossed the paper on the
      clerk's desk. &ldquo;Eh, what?&mdash;no joke about that, Mr. Saul. I found it
      under my door this morning.&rdquo; Mr. Saul glanced at the penciled lines and
      drew in his breath sharply. &ldquo;What do you make of it, sir?&rdquo; demanded the
      judge anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, you'll do as you please, but I'd keep still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you regard this as an authentic expression, sir, and not as the
      joke of some irresponsible humorist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's authentic enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Saul impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge gave a sigh of relief; he could have hugged the little clerk who
      had put to rest certain miserable doubts that had assailed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I wish it known that I hold the writer and his threats in contempt;
      if I have given offense it is to an element I shall never seek to
      conciliate.&rdquo; Mr. Saul was clearly divided between his admiration for the
      judge's courage and fear for his safety. &ldquo;One thing is proven, sir,&rdquo; the
      judge went on; &ldquo;the man who murdered that poor boy is in our midst; that
      point can no longer be disputed. Now, where are their fine-spun theories
      as to how he crossed to the Arkansas coast? What does their mass of
      speculation and conjecture amount to in the face of this?&rdquo; He breathed
      deep. &ldquo;My God, sir, the murderer may be the very next man you pass the
      time of day with!&rdquo; Mr. Saul shivered uncomfortably. &ldquo;And the case in the
      hands of that pin-headed fool, Betts!&rdquo; The judge laughed derisively as he
      bowed himself out. He left it with Mr. Saul to disseminate the news. The
      judge strutted home with his hat cocked over one eye, and his chest
      expanded to such limits that it menaced all his waistcoat buttons. Perhaps
      he was under observation. Ah, let the cutthroats look their full at him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He established himself in his office. He had scarcely done so when Mr.
      Betts knocked at the door. The sheriff came direct from Mr. Saul and
      arrived out of breath, but the letter was not mentioned by the judge. He
      spoke of the crops, the chance of rain, and the intricacies of county
      politics. The sheriff withdrew mystified, wondering why it was he had not
      felt at liberty to broach the subject which was uppermost in his mind. His
      place was taken by Mr. Pegloe, and on the heels of the tavern-keeper came
      Mr. Bowen. Judge Price received them with condescension, but back of the
      condescension was an air of reserve that did not invite questions. The
      judge discussed the extension of the national roads with Mr. Pegloe, and
      the religion of the Persian fire-worshipers with Mr. Bowen; he permitted
      never a pause and they retired as the sheriff had done without sight of
      the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge's office became a perfect Mecca for the idle and the curious,
      and while he overflowed with high-bred courtesy he had never seemed so
      unapproachable&mdash;never so remote from matters of local and
      contemporary interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you show 'em the letter?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Mahaffy, when they were
      alone. &ldquo;Can't you see they are suffering for a sight of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in good time, Solomon.&rdquo; He became thoughtful. &ldquo;Solomon, I am thinking
      of offering a reward for any information that will lead to the discovery
      of my anonymous correspondent,&rdquo; he at length observed with a finely casual
      air, as if the idea had just occurred to him, and had not been seething in
      his brain all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go, Price&mdash;&rdquo; began Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon, this is no time for me to hang back. I shall offer a reward of
      five thousand dollars for this information.&rdquo; The judge's tone was
      resolute. &ldquo;Yes, sir, I shall make the figure commensurate with the
      poignant grief I feel. He was my friend and client&mdash;&rdquo; The moisture
      gathered in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that fifty dollars was nearer to being your figure,&rdquo;
       suggested the cautious Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inadequate and most insulting,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where do you expect to get five thousand dollars?&rdquo; cried Mahaffy in
      a tone of absolute exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where would I get fifty?&rdquo; inquired the judge mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Mahaffy frankly owned himself beaten. A gleam of admiration lit
      up his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price, you have a streak of real greatness!&rdquo; he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the day was over it was generally believed that the judge was
      wearing his gag with humility; interest in him declined, still the public
      would have been grateful for a sight of that letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks, he's nothing but an old windbag!&rdquo; said Mr. Pegloe to a group of
      loungers gathered before his tavern in the early evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the judge's door opened and that gentleman appeared on his
      threshold with a lighted candle in each hand. Glancing neither to the
      right nor the left he passed out and up the street. Not a breath of wind
      was blowing and the flames of the two candles burnt clear and strong,
      lighting up his stately advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner of the court-house green stood a row of locust hitching
      posts. Two of these the judge decorated with his candles, next he measured
      off fifteen paces, strides as liberal as he could make them without
      sacrifice to his dignity; he scored a deep line in the dust with the heel
      of his boot, toed it squarely, and drew himself up to his fullest height.
      His right hand was seen to disappear under the frayed tails of his coat,
      it reappeared and was raised with a movement quicker than the eye could
      follow and a pistol shot rang out. One of the candles was neatly snuffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge allowed himself a covert glance in the direction of the loungers
      before the tavern. He was aware that a larger audience was assembling. A
      slight smile relaxed the firm set of his lips. The remaining candle
      sputtered feebly. The judge walked to the post and cleared the wick from
      tallow with his thumb-nail. There was no haste in any of his movements;
      his was the deliberation of conscious efficiency. Resuming his former
      station back of the line he had drawn in the dusty road he permitted his
      eye to gauge the distance afresh, then his hand was seen to pass deftly to
      his left hip pocket, the long barrel of the rifle pistol was leveled, the
      piece cracked, and the candle's yellow flame vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge pocketed his pistol, walked down the street, and with never a
      glance toward the tavern reentered his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning it was discovered that sometime during the night the
      judge had tacked his anonymous communication on the court-house door; just
      below it was another sheet of paper covered with bold script:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: Judge Slocum Price assumes that the above was
      intended for him since he found it under his office door on the morning of
      the twenty-fifth inst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Price begs leave to state it as his unqualified conviction that the
      writer is a coward and a cur, and offers a reward of five thousand dollars
      for any information that will lead to his identification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Price has stated that he would conduct an intelligently directed
      investigation of the Norton murder mystery without remuneration. He has
      the honor to assure his friends that he is still willing to do so;
      however, he takes this opportunity to warn the public that each day's
      delay is a matter of the utmost gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Furthermore, judge Price avails himself on this occasion to say that he
      has no wish to avoid personal conclusions with the murderers and
      cutthroats who are terrorizing this community; on the contrary, he will
      continue earnestly to seek such personal conclusions.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV. THE CABIN ACROSS THE BAYOU
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tom Ware was seated alone over his breakfast. He had left his bed as the
      pale morning light crept across the great fields that were alike his pride
      and his despair&mdash;what was the use of trying to sleep when sleep was
      an impossibility! The memory of that tragedy at the church door was a
      black horror to him; it gave substance to his dreams, it brought him awake
      with writhing lips that voiced his fear in the dead stillness of the
      night. The days were scarcely less terrible. Steeled and resolute as his
      will could make him, he was not able to speak of what he had seen with
      composure. Being as he was in this terribly perturbed state he had shirked
      his morning toilet and presented a proportionately haggard and unkempt
      appearance. He was about to quit the table when big Steve entered the room
      to say there was a white fellow at the door wished to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch him along in here,&rdquo; said Ware briefly, without lifting his
      bloodshot eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brought into his presence the white fellow delivered a penciled note which
      proved to be from Murrell, and then on Ware's invitation partook of
      whisky. When he was gone, the planter ordered his horse, and while he
      waited for it to be brought up from the stables, reread Murrell's note.
      The expression of his unprepossessing features indicated what was passing
      in his mind, his mood was one of sullen rebellion. He felt Murrell was
      bent on committing him to an aggregate of crime he would never have
      considered possible, and all for love of a girl&mdash;a pink-cheeked,
      white-faced chit of a girl&mdash;disgust boiled up within him, rage choked
      him; this was the rotten spot in Murrell's make-up, the man was mad-stark
      mad!
    </p>
    <p>
      As Ware rode away from Belle Plain he cursed him under his breath with
      vindictive thoroughness. His own inclination toward evil was never very
      robust; he could have connived and schemed over a long period of years to
      despoil Betty of her property, he would have counted this a legitimate
      field for enterprise; but murder and abduction was quite another thing. He
      would wash his hands of all further connection with Murrell, he had other
      things to lose besides Belle Plain, and the present would be as good a
      time as any to let the outlaw know he could be coerced and bullied no
      longer. But he had a saving recollection of the way in which Murrell dealt
      with what he counted treachery; an unguarded word, and he would not dare
      to travel those roads even at broad noon-day, while to pass before a
      lighted window at night would be to invite death; nowhere would he be
      safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three miles from Belle Plain he entered a bridle path that led toward the
      river; he was now traversing a part of the Quintard tract. Two miles from
      the point where he had quitted the main road he came out upon the shores
      of a wide bayou. Looking across this he saw at a distance of half a mile
      what seemed to be a clearing of considerable extent, it was the first sign
      of human occupation he had seen since leaving Belle Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      An impenetrable swamp defended the head of the bayou which he skirted.
      Doubling back as though he were going to retrace his steps to Belle Plain,
      finally he gained a position opposite the clearing which still showed
      remotely across the wide reach of sluggish water. Here he dismounted and
      tied his horse, then as one tolerably familiar with the locality and its
      resources, he went down to the shore and launched a dugout which he found
      concealed in some bushes; entering it he pointed its blunt bow in the
      direction of the clearing opposite. A growth of small timber was still
      standing along the water's edge, but as he drew nearer, those betterments
      which the resident of that lonely spot had seen fit to make for his own
      convenience, came under his scrutiny; these consisted of a log cabin and
      several lesser sheds. Landing and securing his dug-out by the simple
      expedient of dragging half its length out of the water, he advanced toward
      the cabin. As he did so he saw two women at work heckling flax under an
      open shed. They were the wife and daughter of George Hicks, his overseer's
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, Mrs. Hicks,&rdquo; he said, addressing himself to the mother, a
      hulking ruffian of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy, sir?&rdquo; she answered. Her daughter glanced indifferently in Ware's
      direction. She was a fine strapping girl, giving that sense of physical
      abundance which the planter admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'd better keep her out of Murrell's way!&rdquo; he thought; aloud he said,
      &ldquo;Anybody with the captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel Fentress is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered Ware. He moved to the door of the cabin and pushing it
      open, entered the room where Murrell and Fentress were seated facing each
      other across the breakfast table. The planter nodded curtly. He had not
      seen Murrell since the murder, and the sight of him quickened the spirit
      of antagonism which he had been nursing. &ldquo;You roust a fellow out early
      enough!&rdquo; he grumbled, rubbing his unshaven chin with the back of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you'd be gone somewhere. Sit down&mdash;here, between the
      colonel and me,&rdquo; said Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what the devil do you want of me anyhow?&rdquo; demanded the planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's your sister, Tom?&rdquo; inquired Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon she's the way you'd expect her to be.&rdquo; Ware dropped his voice to
      a whisper. Those women were just the other side of the logs, he could hear
      them at their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's at Belle Plain now?&rdquo; continued Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bowen's wife and daughter have stayed,&rdquo; answered Ware, still in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For how long, Tom? Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were to go home after breakfast this morning; the daughter's to come
      out again to-morrow and stay with Betty until she leaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that you're saying?&rdquo; cried Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's going back to North Carolina to those friends of hers; it's no
      concern of mine, she does what she likes without consulting me.&rdquo; There was
      a brief pause during which Murrell scowled at the planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon your heart's tender, too!&rdquo; he presently said. Ware's dull glance
      shifted to Fentress, but the colonel's cold and impassive exterior forbade
      the thought that his sympathy had been roused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that,&rdquo; Ware muttered, moistening his lips. He felt the utter
      futility of opposition. &ldquo;I am for letting things rest just where they
      are,&rdquo; again his voice slid into a husky whisper. &ldquo;You'll be running all
      our heads into a halter, the first thing you know&mdash;and this isn't any
      place to talk over such matters, there are too many people about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only Bess and the old woman busy outside,&rdquo; said Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's to hinder them from sticking an ear to a chink in the logs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, and finish what you've got to say, and get it off your mind,&rdquo; said
      Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I want to tell you that I consider you didn't regard me at
      all in the way you managed that business at the church! If I had known
      what was due to happen there, do you think I'd have gone near the place?
      But you let me go! I met you on the road and you told me you'd learned
      Norton had been to see Bowen, you told me that much, but you didn't tell
      me near all you might!&rdquo; Ware was bitter and resentful; again he felt the
      sweat of a mortal terror drip from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the best thing for you that it happened the way it did,&rdquo; rejoined
      Murrell coolly. &ldquo;No one will ever think you had a hand in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't right! You placed me in the meanest kind of a situation,&rdquo;
       objected Ware sullenly, mopping his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think I was going to let the marriage take place? You knew he had
      been warned to keep away from her,&rdquo; said Murrell. There was a movement
      overhead in the loft, the loose clapboards with which it was floored
      creaked under a heavy tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that? Hicks?&rdquo; asked Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't Hicks&mdash;never mind who it is, Tom,&rdquo; answered Murrell
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you'd sent him out of the county?&rdquo; muttered Ware, his face
      livid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Tom, I don't ask your help, but I won't stand your
      interference. I'm going to have the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, you'll ruin yourself with your damned crazy infatuation!&rdquo; It was
      Fentress, no longer able to control himself, who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't, Colonel, but I'm not going to discuss that. All I want is
      for Tom to go to Memphis and stay there for a couple of days. When he
      comes back Belle Plain and its niggers will be as good as his. I am going
      to take the girl away from there to-night. I don't ask your help and you
      needn't ask what comes of her afterward. That will be my affair.&rdquo;
       Murrell's burning eyes shifted from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful and accomplished young lady&mdash;a great heiress&mdash;is to
      disappear and no solution of the mystery demanded by the public at large!&rdquo;
       said Fentress with an acid smile. Murrell laughed contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this fuss over Norton's death amounted to?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you have come to the end of that, John?&rdquo; inquired Fentress,
      still smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't propose to debate this further,&rdquo; rejoined Murrell haughtily.
      Instantly the colonel's jaw became rigid. The masterful airs of this
      cutthroat out of the hills irked him beyond measure. Murrell turned to
      Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon can you get away from here, Tom?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, I can't go too soon!&rdquo; cried the planter, staggering to his feet.
      He gave Fentress a hopeless beaten look. &ldquo;You're my witness that first and
      last I've no part in this!&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel merely shrugged his shoulders. Murrell reached out a detaining
      hand and rested it on Ware's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your wits about you, Tom, and within a week people will have
      forgotten all about Norton and your sister. I am going to give them
      something else to worry over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ware went from the cabin, and as the door swung shut Fentress faced
      Murrell across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've gone as far with you in this affair as I can go; after all, as you
      say, it is a private matter. You reap the benefits&mdash;you and Tom
      between you&mdash;I shall give you a wide berth until you come to your
      senses. Frankly, if you think that in this late day in the world you can
      carry off an unwilling girl, your judgment is faulty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Colonel&mdash;how do you know she is going to prove unwilling?&rdquo;
       objected Murrell, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fentress gave him a glance of undisguised contempt and rose from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit your past successes, John&mdash;that is, I take your word for
      them&mdash;but Miss Malroy is a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard enough!&rdquo; said Murrell angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I, John,&rdquo; retorted the colonel in a tone that was unvexed but
      final, &ldquo;and I shall count it a favor if you will never refer to her in my
      hearing.&rdquo; He moved in the direction of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you and I are not going to lose our tempers over this!&rdquo; began
      Murrell. &ldquo;Come, sit down again, Colonel!&rdquo; he concluded with great good
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall never agree, John&mdash;you have one idea and I another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll let the whole matter drop out of our talk. Look here, how about the
      boy&mdash;are you ready for him if I can get my hands on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fentress considered. From the facts he had gathered he knew that the man
      who called himself Judge Price must soon run his course in Raleigh, and
      then as inevitably push out for fresh fields. Any morning might find him
      gone and the boy with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't take him to my place as I had intended doing; under the
      circumstances that is out of the question,&rdquo; he said at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; but I'll send him either up or down the river and place him in
      safe keeping where you can get him any time you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be done without violence, John!&rdquo; stipulated Fentress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I understand that perfectly well. It wouldn't suit your
      schemes to have that brace of old sots handled by the Clan. Which shall it
      be&mdash;up or down river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you take care of him for me below, at Natchez?&rdquo; inquired Fentress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well there as anywhere, Colonel, and he'll pass into safe hands; he
      won't give me the slip the second time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Fentress, and took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the window Murrell watched him cross the clearing, followed by the
      girl, Bess, who was to row him over to the opposite shore. He reflected
      that these men&mdash;the Wares and Fentresses and their like&mdash;were
      keen enough where they had schemes of their own they wished put through;
      it was only when he reached out empty hands that they reckoned the
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three-quarters of an hour slipped by, then, piercing the silence, Murrell
      heard a shrill whistle; it was twice repeated; he saw Bess go down to the
      landing again. A half-hour elapsed and a man issued from the scattering
      growth of bushes that screened the shore. The new-comer crossed the
      clearing and entered the cabin. He was a young fellow of twenty-four or
      five, whose bronzed and sunburnt face wore a somewhat reckless expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain, what's doing?&rdquo; he asked, as he shook hands with Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been waiting for you, Hues,&rdquo; said Murrell. He continued, &ldquo;I reckon
      the time's here when nothing will be gained by delay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hues dropped down on a three-legged stool and looked at the outlaw fixedly
      and in silence for a moment. At length he nodded understandingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything's to be done, now is the time. What have you to report?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've seen the council of each Clan division. They are ripe to start
      this thing off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murrell gave him a moment of moody regard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice already I've named the day and hour, but now I'm going to put it
      through!&rdquo; He set his teeth and thrust out his jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, you're the greatest fellow in America! Inside of a week men who
      have never been within five hundred miles of you will be asking each other
      who John Murrell is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murrell had expected to part with Hues then and there and for all time,
      but Hues possessed qualities which might still be of use to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you expect to do for yourself?&rdquo; he demanded. The other laughed
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, I'm going to get rich while I have the chance. Ain't that what
      we are all after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired Murrell quietly. Hues shifted his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sensitive about calling things by their short names;&rdquo; he gave way to
      easy laughter; &ldquo;but if you've got anything special you're saving for
      yourself, I'm free to say I'd rather take chances with you than with
      another,&rdquo; he finished carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hues, you must start back across Tennessee. Make it Sunday at midnight&mdash;that's
      three days off.&rdquo; Unconsciously his voice sank to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunday at midnight,&rdquo; repeated Hues slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have passed the word into middle Tennessee, turn south and make
      the best of your way to New Orleans. Don't stop for anything&mdash;push
      through as fast as you can. You'll find me there. I've a notion you and I
      will quit the country together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quit the country! Why, Captain, who's talking of quitting the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as though you were fool enough to think the niggers would
      accomplish something!&rdquo; said Murrell coolly. &ldquo;There will be confusion at
      first, but there are enough white men in the southwest to handle a heap
      better organized insurrection than we'll be able to set going. Our fellows
      will have to use their heads as well as their hands or they are likely to
      help the nigger swallow his medicine. I look for nothing else than
      considerable of a shake-up along the Mississippi... what with lynchers and
      regulators a man will have to show a clean bill of health to be allowed to
      live, no matter what his color&mdash;just being white won't help him any!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you're right, it won't!&rdquo; and again Hues gave way to easy laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you've done your work you strike south as I tell you and join me.
      I'm going to keep New Orleans for myself&mdash;it's my ambition to destroy
      the city Old Hickory saved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then it's change your name and strike out for Texas with what you've
      picked up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn't! I'll have my choice of men&mdash;a river full of ships.
      Look here, there's South America, or some of those islands in the gulf
      with a black-and-tan population and a few white mongrels holding on to
      civilization by their eye-teeth; what's to hinder our setting up shop for
      ourselves? Two or three hundred Americans could walk off with an island
      like Hayti, for instance&mdash;and it's black with niggers. What we'd done
      here would be just so much capital down there. We'd make it a
      stamping-ground for the Clan! In the next two years we could bring in a
      couple of thousand Americans and then we'd be ready to take over their
      government, whether they liked it or not, and run it at a profit. We'd put
      the niggers back in slavery where they belong, and set them at work
      raising sugar and tobacco for their new bosses. Man, it's the richest land
      in the world, I tell you&mdash;and the mountains are full of gold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hues had kindled with a ready enthusiasm while Murrell was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds right, Captain&mdash;we'd have a country and a flag of our
      own&mdash;and I look at those free niggers as just so much boot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take only picked men with me&mdash;I can't give ship room to any
      other&mdash;but I want you. You'll join me in New Orleans?&rdquo; said Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you start south?&rdquo; asked Hues quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inside of two days. I've got some private business to settle before I
      leave. I'll hang round here until that's attended to.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXV. THE JUDGE EXTENDS HIS CREDIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      That afternoon Judge Price walked out to Belle Plain. Solomon Mahaffy had
      known that this was a civility Betty Malroy could by no means escape. He
      had been conscious of the judge's purpose from the moment it existed in
      the germ state, and he had striven to divert him, but his striving had
      been in vain, for though the judge valued Mr. Mahaffy because of certain
      sterling qualities which he professed to discern beneath the hard crust
      that made up the external man, he was not disposed to accept him as his
      mentor in nice matters of taste and gentlemanly feeling. He owed it to
      himself personally to tender his sympathy. Miss Malroy must have heard
      something of the honorable part he had played; surely she could not be in
      ignorance of the fact that the lawless element, dreading his further
      activities, had threatened him. She must know, too, about that reward of
      five thousand dollars. Certainly her grief could not blind her to the fact
      that he had met the situation with a largeness of public spirit that was
      an impressive lesson to the entire community.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These were all points over which he and Mahaffy had wrangled, and he felt
      that his friend, in seeking to keep him away from Belle Plain, was
      standing squarely in his light. He really could not understand Solomon or
      his objections. He pointed out that Norton had probably left a will&mdash;no
      one knew yet&mdash;probably his estate would go to his intended wife&mdash;what
      more likely? He understood Norton had cousins somewhere in middle
      Tennessee&mdash;there was the attractive possibility of extended
      litigation. Miss Malroy needed a strong, clear brain to guide her past
      those difficulties his agile fancy assembled in her path. He beamed on his
      friend with a wide sunny smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean she needs a lawyer, Price?&rdquo; insinuated Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That slap at me, Solomon, is unworthy of you. Just name some one, will
      you, who has shown an interest comparable to mine? I may say I have
      devoted my entire energy to her affairs, and with disinterestedness. I
      have made myself felt. Will you mention who else these cutthroats have
      tried to browbeat and frighten? They know that my theories and conclusions
      are a menace to them! I got 'em in a panic, sir&mdash;presently some
      fellow will lose his nerve and light out for the tall timber&mdash;and it
      will be just Judge Slocum Price who's done the trick&mdash;no one else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you looking for some one to take a pot shot at you?&rdquo; inquired Mahaffy
      sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your remark uncovers my fondest hope, Solomon&mdash;I'd give five years
      of my life just to be shot at&mdash;that would round out the episode of
      the letter nicely;&rdquo; again the judge beamed on Mahaffy with that wide and
      sunny smile of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you let the boy go alone, Price?&rdquo; suggested Mahaffy. He lacked
      that sense of sublime confidence in the judge's tact and discretion of
      which the judge, himself, entertained never a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not obtrude myself, Solomon; I shall merely walk out to Belle
      Plain and leave a civil message. I know what's due Miss Malroy in her
      bereaved state&mdash;she has sustained no ordinary loss, and in no
      ordinary fashion. She has been the center of a striking and profoundly
      moving tragedy! I would give a good deal to know if my late client left a
      will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might ask her,&rdquo; said Mahaffy cynically. &ldquo;Nothing like going to
      headquarters for the news!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon, Solomon, give me credit for common sense&mdash;go further, and
      give me credit for common decency! Don't let us forget that ever since we
      came here she has manifested a charmingly hospitable spirit where we are
      concerned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't charity hit nearer the mark, Price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never so regarded it, Solomon,&rdquo; said the judge mildly. &ldquo;I have
      read a different meaning in the beef and flour and potatoes she's sent
      here. I expect if the truth could be known to us she is wondering in the
      midst of her grief why I haven't called, but she'll appreciate the
      considerate delicacy of a gentleman. I wish it were possible to get cut
      flowers in this cussed wilderness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge had been occupied with a simple but ingenious toilet. He had
      trimmed the frayed skirts of, his coat; then by turning his cuffs inside
      out and upside down a fresh surface made its first public appearance. Next
      his shoes had engaged his attention. They might have well discouraged a
      less resolute and resourceful character, but with the contents of his
      ink-well he artfully colored his white yarn socks where they showed though
      the rifts in the leather. This the judge did gaily, now humming a snatch
      of song, now listening civilly to Mahaffy, now replying with undisturbed
      cheerfulness. Last of all he clapped his dingy beaver on his head, giving
      it an indescribably jaunty slant, and stepped to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wish me luck, Solomon, I'm off&mdash;come, Hannibal!&rdquo; he said. At
      heart he cherished small hope of seeing Betty, advantageous as he felt an
      interview might prove. However, on reaching Belle Plain he and Hannibal
      were shown into the cool parlor by little Steve. It was more years than
      the judge cared to remember since he had put his foot inside such a house,
      but with true grandeur of soul he rose to the occasion; a sublimated
      dignity shone from every battered feature, while he fixed little Steve
      with so fierce a glance that the grin froze on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to say that judge Slocum Price presents his compliments and
      condolences to Miss Malroy&mdash;have you got that straight, you pinch of
      soot?&rdquo; he concluded affably. Little Steve, impressed alike by the judge's
      air of condescension and his easy flow of words, signified that he had.
      &ldquo;You may also say that judge Price's ward, young Master Hazard, presents
      his compliments and condolences&mdash;&rdquo; What more the judge might have
      said was interrupted by the entrance of Betty, herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady&mdash;&rdquo; the judge bowed, then he advanced toward her
      with the solemnity of carriage and countenance he deemed suitable to the
      occasion, and her extended hand was engulfed between his two plump palms.
      He rolled his eyes heavenward. &ldquo;It's the Lord's to deal with us as His own
      inscrutable wisdom dictates,&rdquo; he murmured with pious resignation. &ldquo;We are
      all poorer, ma'am, that he has died&mdash;just as we were richer while he
      lived!&rdquo; The rich cadence of the judge's speech fell sonorously on the
      silence, and that look of horror which had never quite left Betty's eyes
      since they saw Charley Norton fall, rose out of their clear depths again.
      The judge, instantly stricken with a sense of the inadequacy of his words,
      doubled on his spiritual tracks. &ldquo;In a round-about way, ma'am, we're bound
      to believe in the omnipresence of Providence&mdash;we must think it&mdash;though
      a body might be disposed to hold that west Tennessee had got out of the
      line of divine supervision recently. Let me lead you to a chair, ma'am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal had slipped to Betty's side and placed his hand in hers. The
      judge regarded the pair with great benevolence of expression. &ldquo;He would
      come, and I hadn't the heart to forbid it. If I can be of any service to
      you, ma'am, either in the capacity of a friend&mdash;or professionally&mdash;I
      trust you will not hesitate to command me&mdash;&rdquo; The judge backed toward
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you walk out, Judge Price?&rdquo; asked Betty kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more than a healthful exercise&mdash;but we will not detain you,
      ma'am; the pleasure of seeing you is something we had not reckoned on!&rdquo;
       The judge's speech was thick and unctuous with good feeling. He wished
      that Mahaffy might have been there to note the reserve and dignity of his
      deportment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must let me order luncheon for you,&rdquo; said Betty. At least this
      questionable old man was good to Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't think of it, ma'am&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have a glass of wine, then,&rdquo; urged Betty hospitably. For the
      moment she had lost sight of what was clearly the judge's besetting sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge paused abruptly. He endured a moment of agonizing irresolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the advice of my physician I dare not touch wine&mdash;gout, ma'am,
      and liver&mdash;but this restriction does not apply to corn whisky&mdash;in
      moderation, and as a tonic&mdash;either before meals, immediately after
      meals or at any time between meals&mdash;always keeping in mind the idea
      of its tonic properties&mdash;&rdquo; The judge seemed to mellow and ripen. This
      was much better than having the dogs sicked on you! His manner toward
      Betty became almost fatherly. Poor young thing, so lonely and desolate in
      the midst of all this splendor&mdash;he surreptitiously wiped away a tear,
      and when little Steve presented himself and was told to bring whisky,
      audibly smacked his lips&mdash;a whole lot better, surely!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry you think you must hurry away, Judge Price,&rdquo; said Betty. She
      still retained the small brown hand Hannibal had thrust into hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The eastern mail gets in to-day, ma'am, and I have reason to think my
      share of it will be especially heavy, for it brings the bulk of my
      professional correspondence.&rdquo; In ten years the judge had received just one
      communication by mail&mdash;a bill which had followed him through four
      states and seven counties. &ldquo;I expect my secretary&mdash;&rdquo; boldly fixing
      Solomon Mahaffy's status, &ldquo;is already dipping into it; an excellent
      assistant, ma'am, but literary rather than legal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Steve reappeared bearing a silver tray on which was a decanter and
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you insist, ma'am,&rdquo; the judge poured himself a drink, &ldquo;my best
      respects&mdash;&rdquo; he bowed profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are quite willing, judge, I think I will keep Hannibal. Miss
      Bowen, who has been here&mdash;since&mdash;&rdquo; her voice broke suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand, ma'am,&rdquo; said the judge soothingly. He gave her a glance of
      great concern and turned to Hannibal. &ldquo;Dear lad, you'll be very quiet and
      obedient, and do exactly as Miss Malroy says? When shall I come for him,
      ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send him to you when he is ready to go home. I am thinking of
      visiting my friends in North Carolina, and I should like to have him spend
      as much time as possible with me before I start for the East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had occurred to Betty that she had done little or nothing for the
      child; probably this would be her last opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of the judge's feelings was such that with elaborate absence of
      mind he poured himself a second drink of whisky; and that there should be
      no doubt the act was one of inadvertence, said again, &ldquo;My best respects,
      ma'am,&rdquo; and bowed as before. Putting down the glass he backed toward the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust you will not hesitate to call upon me if I can be of any use to
      you, ma'am&mdash;a message will bring me here without a moment's delay.&rdquo;
       He was rather disappointed that no allusion had been made to his recent
      activities. He reasoned correctly that Betty was as yet in ignorance of
      the somewhat dangerous eminence he had achieved as the champion of law and
      order. However, he reflected with satisfaction that Hannibal, in
      remaining, would admirably serve his ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty insisted that he should be driven home, and after faintly
      protesting, the judge gracefully yielded the point, and a few moments
      later rolled away from Belle Plain behind a pair of sleek-coated bays,
      with a negro in livery on the box. He was conscious of a great sense of
      exaltation. He felt that he should paralyze Mahaffy. He even temporarily
      forgot the blow his hopes had sustained when Betty spoke of returning to
      North Carolina. This was life&mdash;broad acres and niggers&mdash;principally
      to trot after you toting liquor&mdash;and such liquor!&mdash;he lolled
      back luxuriantly with half-closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty years in the wood if an hour!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I'd like to have just
      such a taste in my mouth when I come to die&mdash;and probably she has
      barrels of it!&rdquo; he sighed deeply, and searched his soul for words with
      which adequately to describe that whisky to Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why not do more than paralyze Solomon&mdash;that would be pleasant but
      not especially profitable. The judge came back quickly to the vexed
      problem of his future. He desired to make some striking display of Miss
      Malroy's courtesy. He knew that his credit was experiencing the pangs of
      an early mortality; he was not sensitive, yet for some days he had been
      sensible of the fact that what he called the commercial class was viewing
      him with open disfavor, but he must hang on in Raleigh a little longer&mdash;for
      him it had become the abode of hope. The judge considered the matter. At
      least he could let people see something of that decent respect with which
      Miss Malroy treated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were entering Raleigh now, and he ordered the coachman to pull his
      horses down to a walk. He had decided to make use of the Belle Plain
      turnout in creating an atmosphere of confidence and trust&mdash;especially
      trust. To this end he spent the best part of an hour interviewing his
      creditors. It amounted almost to a mass-meeting of the adult male
      population, for he had no favorites. When he invaded virgin territory he
      believed in starting the largest possible number of accounts without
      delay. The advantage of his system, as he explained its workings to
      Mahaffy, was that it bred a noble spirit of emulation. He let it be known
      in a general way that things were looking up with him; just in what
      quarter he did not specify, but there he was, seated in the Belle Plain
      carriage and the inference was unavoidable that Miss Malroy was to
      recognize his activities in a substantial manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy, loafing away the afternoon in the county clerk's office, heard of
      the judge's return. He heard that Charley Norton had left a will; that
      Thicket Point went to Miss Malroy; that the Norton cousins in middle
      Tennessee were going to put up a fight; that Judge Price had been retained
      as counsel by Miss Malroy; that he was authorized to begin an independent
      search for Charley Norton's murderer, and was to spare no expense; that
      Judge Price was going to pay his debts. Mahaffy grinned at this and
      hurried home. He could believe all but the last, that was the crowning
      touch of unreality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge explained the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't withhold hope from any man, Solomon; it's the cheapest thing
      in the world and the one thing we are most miserly about extending to our
      fellows. These people all feel better&mdash;and what did it cost me?&mdash;just
      a little decent consideration; just the knowledge of what the unavoidable
      associations of ideas in their own minds would do for them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What had seemed the corpse of credit breathed again, and the judge and
      Mahaffy immediately embarked upon a characteristic celebration. Early
      candlelight found them making a beginning; midnight came&mdash;the gray
      and purple of dawn&mdash;and they were still at it, back of closed doors
      and shuttered windows.

      CHAPTER XXVI. BETTY LEAVES BELLE PLAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hannibal had devoted himself loyally to the judge's glorification, and
      Betty heard all about the letter, the snuffing of the candles and the
      reward of five thousand dollars. It vastly increased the child's sense of
      importance and satisfaction when he discovered she had known nothing of
      these matters until he told her of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where would Judge Price get so much money, Hannibal?&rdquo; she asked,
      greatly astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't have to get it, Miss Betty; Mr. Mahaffy says he don't reckon no
      one will ever tell who wrote the letter&mdash;he 'lows the man who done
      that will keep pretty mum&mdash;he just dassent tell!&rdquo; the boy explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not&mdash;&rdquo; and Betty saw that perhaps, after all, the
      judge had not assumed any very great financial responsibility. &ldquo;He can't
      be a coward, though, Hannibal!&rdquo; she added, for she understood that the
      risk of personal violence which he ran was quite genuine. She had formed
      her own unsympathetic estimate of him that day at Boggs' race-track;
      Mahaffy in his blackest hour could have added nothing to it. Twice since
      then she had met him in Raleigh, which had only served to fix that first
      impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Betty, he's just like my Uncle Bob was&mdash;he ain't afraid of
      nothing! He totes them pistols of his&mdash;loaded&mdash;if you notice
      good you can see where they bulge out his coat!&rdquo; Hannibal's eyes, very
      round and big, looked up into hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he as poor as he seems, Hannibal?&rdquo; inquired Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never has no money, Miss Betty, but I don't reckon he's what a body
      would call pore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It might have baffled a far more mature intelligence than Hannibal's to
      comprehend those peculiar processes by which the judge sustained himself
      and his intimate fellowship with adversity&mdash;that it was his
      magnificence of mind which made the squalor of his daily life seem merely
      a passing phase&mdash;but the boy had managed to point a delicate
      distinction, and Betty grasped something of the hope and faith which never
      quite died out in Slocum Price's indomitable breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you always have enough to eat, dear?&rdquo; she questioned anxiously.
      Hannibal promptly reassured her on this point. &ldquo;You wouldn't let me think
      anything that was not true, Hannibal&mdash;you are quite sure you have
      never been hungry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, Miss Betty; honest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty gave a sigh of relief. She had been reproaching herself for her
      neglect of the child; she had meant to do so much for him and had done
      nothing! Now it was too late for her personally to interest herself in his
      behalf, yet before she left for the East she would provide for him. If she
      had felt it was possible to trust the judge she would have made him her
      agent, but even in his best aspect he seemed a dubious dependence. Tom,
      for quite different reasons, was equally out of the question. She thought
      of Mr. Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a man is Mr. Mahaffy, Hannibal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's an awful nice man, Miss Betty, only he never lets on; a body's got
      to find it out for his own self&mdash;he ain't like the judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he&mdash;drink, too, Hannibal?&rdquo; questioned Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; when he can get the licker, he does.&rdquo; It was evident that
      Hannibal was cheerfully tolerant of this weakness on the part of the
      austere Mahaffy. By this time Betty was ready to weep over the child, with
      his knowledge of shabby vice, and his fresh young faith in those old
      tatterdemalions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, no matter what they do, they are very, very kind to you?&rdquo; she
      continued quite tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am&mdash;why, Miss Betty, they're lovely men!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you ever hear the things spoken of you learned about at Mrs.
      Ferris' Sunday-school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the judge is drunk he talks a heap about 'em. It's beautiful to hear
      him then; you'd love it, Miss Betty,&rdquo; and Hannibal smiled up sweetly into
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he have you go to Sunday-school in Raleigh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't got no clothes that's fitten to wear, nor no pennies to give, but
      the judge, he 'lows that as soon as he can make a raise I got to go, and
      he's learning me my letters&mdash;but we ain't a book. Miss Betty, I
      reckon it'd stump you some to guess how he's fixed it for me to learn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's drawn the letters for you, is that the way?&rdquo; In spite of herself,
      Betty was experiencing a certain revulsion of feeling where the judge and
      Mahaffy were concerned. They were doubtless bad enough, but they could
      have been worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; he done soaked the label off one of Mr. Pegloe's whisky
      bottles and pasted it on the wall just as high as my chin, so's I can see
      it good, and he's learning me that-a-ways! Maybe you've seen the kind of
      bottle I mean&mdash;Pegloe's Mississippi Pilot: Pure Corn Whisky?&rdquo; But
      Hannibal's bright little face fell. He was quick to see that the
      educational system devised by the judge did not impress Betty at all
      favorably. She drew him into her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have my books&mdash;the books I learned to read out of when I
      was a little girl, Hannibal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like learning from the label pretty well,&rdquo; said Hannibal loyally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll like the books better, dear, when you see them. I know just
      where they are, for I happened on them on a shelf in the library only the
      other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After they had found and examined the books and Hannibal had grudgingly
      admitted that they might possess certain points of advantage over the
      label, he and Betty went out for a walk. It was now late afternoon and the
      sun was sinking behind the wall of the forest that rose along the Arkansas
      coast. Their steps had led them to the terrace where they stood looking
      off into the west. It was here that Betty had said good-by to Bruce
      Carrington&mdash;it might have been months ago, and it was only days. She
      thought of Charley&mdash;Charley, with his youth and hope and high courage&mdash;unwittingly
      enough she had led him on to his death! A sob rose in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal looked up into her face. The memory of his own loss was never
      very long absent from his mind, and Miss Betty had been the victim of a
      similarly sinister tragedy. He recalled those first awful days of
      loneliness through which he had lived, when there was no Uncle Bob&mdash;soft-voiced,
      smiling and infinitely companionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hannibal, you are crying&mdash;what about, dear?&rdquo; asked Betty
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; I ain't crying,&rdquo; said Hannibal stoutly, but his wet lashes
      gave the lie to his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you homesick&mdash;do you wish to go back to the judge and Mr.
      Mahaffy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am&mdash;it ain't that&mdash;I was just thinking&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking about what, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About my Uncle Bob.&rdquo; The small face was very wistful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;and you still miss him so much, Hannibal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bet I do&mdash;I reckon anybody who knew Uncle Bob would never get over
      missing him; they just couldn't, Miss Betty! The judge is mighty kind, and
      so is Mr. Mahaffy&mdash;they're awful kind, Miss Betty, and it seems like
      they get kinder all the time&mdash;but with Uncle Bob, when he liked you,
      he just laid himself out to let you know it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does make a great difference, doesn't it?&rdquo; agreed Betty sadly, and
      two piteous tearful eyes were bent upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you reckon if Uncle Bob is alive, like the judge says, and he's
      ever going to find me, he had ought to be here by now?&rdquo; continued Hannibal
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it hasn't been such a great while, Hannibal; it's only that so much
      has happened to you. If he was very badly hurt it may have been weeks
      before he could travel; and then when he could, perhaps he went back to
      that tavern to try to learn what had become of you. But we may be quite
      certain he will never abandon his search until he has made every possible
      effort to find you, dear! That means he will sooner or later come to west
      Tennessee, for there will always be the hope that you have found your way
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I get mighty tired waiting, Miss Betty,&rdquo; confessed the boy.
      &ldquo;Seems like I just couldn't wait no longer.&rdquo; He sighed gently, and then
      his face cleared. &ldquo;You reckon he'll come most any time, don't you, Miss
      Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Hannibal; any day or hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo; muttered Hannibal softly under his breath. Presently he asked:
      &ldquo;Where does that branch take you to?&rdquo; He nodded toward the bayou at the
      foot of the terraced bluff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It empties into the river,&rdquo; answered Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal saw a small skiff beached among the cottonwoods that grew along
      the water's edge and his eyes lighted up instantly. He had a juvenile
      passion for boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you got a boat, ain't you, Miss Betty?&rdquo; This was a charming and an
      important discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to go down to it?&rdquo; inquired Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Deed I would! Does she leak any, Miss Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that. Do boats usually leak, Hannibal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you ain't ever been out rowing in her, Miss Betty, have you?&mdash;and
      there ain't no better fun than rowing a boat!&rdquo; They had started down the
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to think that, too, Hannibal; how do you suppose it is that when
      people grow up they forget all about the really nice things they might
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What use is she if you don't go rowing in her?&rdquo; persisted Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but it is used. Mr. Tom uses it in crossing to the other side where
      they are clearing land for cotton. It saves him a long walk or ride about
      the head of the bayou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like I should take you out in her, Miss Betty?&rdquo; demanded Hannibal with
      palpitating anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had entered the scattering timber when Betty paused suddenly with a
      startled exclamation, and Hannibal felt her fingers close convulsively
      about his. The sound she had heard might have been only the rustling of
      the wind among the branches overhead in that shadowy silence, but Betty's
      nerves, the placid nerves of youth and perfect health, were shattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you hear something, Hannibal?&rdquo; she whispered fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Hannibal pointed mysteriously, and glancing in the direction he
      indicated, Betty saw a woman advancing along the path toward them. The
      look of alarm slowly died out of his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's the overseer's niece,&rdquo; she told Hannibal, and they kept on
      toward the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl came rapidly up the path, which closely followed the irregular
      line of the shore in its windings. Once she was seen to stop and glance
      back over her shoulder, her attitude intent and listening, then she
      hurried forward again. Just by the boat the three met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; said Betty pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl made no reply to this; she merely regarded Betty with a fixed
      stare. At length she broke silence abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got something I want to say to you&mdash;you know who I am, I reckon?&rdquo;
       She was a girl of about Betty's own age, with a certain dark, sullen
      beauty and that physical attraction which Tom, in spite of his vexed mood,
      had taken note of earlier in the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Bess Hicks,&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make the boy go back toward the house a spell&mdash;I got something I
      want to say to you.&rdquo; Betty hesitated. She was offended by the girl's
      manner, which was as rude as her speech. &ldquo;I ain't going to hurt you&mdash;you
      needn't be afraid of me, I got something important to say&mdash;send him
      off, I tell you; there ain't no time to lose!&rdquo; The girl stamped her foot
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty made a sign to Hannibal and he passed slowly back along the path. He
      went unwillingly, and he kept his head turned that he might see what was
      done, even if he were not to hear what was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Hannibal&mdash;wait there&mdash;don't go any farther!&rdquo;
       Betty called after him when he had reached a point sufficiently distant to
      be out of hearing of a conversation carried on in an ordinary tone. &ldquo;Now,
      what is it? Speak quickly if you have anything to tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a heap to say,&rdquo; answered the girl with a scowl. Her manner was
      still fierce and repellent, and she gave Betty a certain jealous regard
      out of her black eyes which the latter was at a loss to explain. &ldquo;Where's
      Mr. Tom?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom? Why, about the place, I suppose&mdash;in his office, perhaps.&rdquo; So it
      had to do with Tom.... Betty felt sudden disgust with the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he ain't about the place, either! He done struck out for Memphis two
      hours after sun-up, and what's more, he ain't coming back here to-night&mdash;&rdquo;
       There was a moment of silence. The girl looked about apprehensively. She
      continued, fixing her black eyes on Betty: &ldquo;You're here alone at Belle
      Plain&mdash;you know what happened when Mr. Tom started for Memphis last
      time? I reckon you-all ain't forgot that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty felt a pallor steal over her face. She rested a hand that shook on
      the trunk of a tree to steady herself. The girl laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be so scared; I reckon Belle Plain's as good as his if anything
      happened to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a great effort Betty gained a measure of control over herself. She took
      a step nearer and looked the girl steadily in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will stop this sort of talk, and tell me what is going to
      happen to me&mdash;if you know?&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you reckon Mr. Norton was shot? I can tell you why&mdash;it was
      all along of you&mdash;that was why!&rdquo; The girl's furtive glance, which
      searched and watched the gathering shadows, came back as it always did to
      Betty's pale face. &ldquo;You ain't no safer than he was, I tell you!&rdquo; and she
      sucked in her breath sharply between her full red lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; faltered Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you reckon you're safe here in the big house alone? Why do you reckon
      Mr. Tom cleared out for Memphis? It was because he couldn't be around and
      have anything happen to you&mdash;that was why!&rdquo; and the girl sank her
      voice to a whisper. &ldquo;You quit Belle Plain now&mdash;to-night&mdash;just as
      soon as you can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is absurd&mdash;you are trying to frighten me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they stop with trying to frighten Charley Norton?&rdquo; demanded Bess with
      harsh insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the promptings that inspired this warning, they plainly had
      nothing to do with either liking or sympathy. Her dominating emotion
      seemed to be a sullen sort of resentment which lit up her glance with a
      dull fire; yet her feelings were so clearly and so keenly personal that
      Betty understood the motive that had brought her there. The explanation,
      she found, left her wondering just where and how her own fate was linked
      with that of this poor white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been waiting some time to see me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since along about noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were afraid to come to the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't want to be seen there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you knew I was alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone&mdash;but how do you know who's watching the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think there was reason to be afraid of that?&rdquo; asked Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the girl stamped her foot with angry impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're just wastin' time&mdash;just foolin' it away&mdash;and you ain't
      got none to spare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must tell me what I have to fear&mdash;I must know more or I shall
      stay just where I am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, stay!&rdquo; The girl turned away, and then as quickly turned back
      and faced Betty once more. &ldquo;I reckon he'd kill me if he knew&mdash;I
      reckon I've earned that already&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of whom are you speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll have you away from here to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He?... who?... and what if I refuse to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they ask Charley Norton whether he wanted to live or die?&rdquo; came the
      sinister question.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shiver passed through Betty. She was seeing it all again&mdash;Charley
      as he groped among the graves with the hand of death heavy upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she was alone. The girl had disappeared. There was only the
      shifting shadows as the wind tossed the branches of the trees, and the
      bands of golden light that slanted along the empty path. The fear of the
      unknown leaped up afresh in Betty's soul, in an instant her flying feet
      had borne her to the boy's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come&mdash;come quick, Hannibal!&rdquo; she gasped out, and seized his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Miss Betty? What's the matter?&rdquo; asked Hannibal as they fled
      panting up the terraces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;only we must get away from here just as soon as we
      can!&rdquo; Then, seeing the look of alarm on the child's face, she added more
      quietly, &ldquo;Don't be frightened, dear, only we must go away from Belle Plain
      at once.&rdquo; But where they were to go, she had not considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the house, they stole up to Betty's room. Her well-filled purse
      was the important thing; that, together with some necessary clothing, went
      into a small hand-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must carry this, Hannibal; if any one sees us leave the house they'll
      think it something you are taking away,&rdquo; she explained. Hannibal nodded
      understandingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you trust your niggers, Miss Betty?&rdquo; he whispered as they went from
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only trust you, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you go? Was it something that woman told you? Are they coming
      after us, Miss Betty? Is it Captain Murrell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Murrell?&rdquo; There was less of mystery now, but more of terror, and
      her hand stole up to her heart, and, white and slim, rested against the
      black fabric of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you be scared, Miss Betty!&rdquo; said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went silently from the house and again crossed the lawn to the
      terrace. Under the leafy arch which canopied them there was already the
      deep purple of twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you reckon it were Captain Murrell shot Mr. Norton, Miss Betty?&rdquo; asked
      Hannibal in a shuddering whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush&mdash;Oh, hush, Hannibal! It is too awful to even speak of&mdash;&rdquo;
       and, sobbing and half hysterical, she covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are we going, Miss Betty?&rdquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, dear!&rdquo; she had an agonizing sense of the night's approach
      and of her own utter helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what, Miss Betty, let's go to the judge and Mr. Mahaffy!&rdquo;
       said Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Price?&rdquo; She had not thought of him as a possible protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Miss Betty, ain't I told you he ain't afraid of nothing? We could
      walk to Raleigh easy if you don't want your niggers to hook up a team for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty suddenly remembered the carriage which had taken the judge into
      town; she was sure it had not yet returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will go to the judge, Hannibal! George, who drove him into Raleigh,
      has not come back; if we hurry we may meet him on the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Screened by the thick shadows, they passed up the path that edged the
      bayou; at the head of the inlet they entered a clearing, and crossing this
      they came to the corn-field which lay between the house and the highroad.
      Following one of the shock rows they hurried to the mouth of the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannibal, I don't want to tell the judge why I am leaving Belle Plain&mdash;about
      the woman, I mean,&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You reckon they'd kill her, don't you, Miss Betty, if they knew what
      she'd done?&rdquo; speculated the boy. It occurred to him that an adequate
      explanation of their flight would require preparation, since the judge was
      at all times singularly alive to the slightest discrepancy of statement.
      They had issued from the cornfield now and were going along the road
      toward Raleigh. Suddenly Betty paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were nothing, Miss Betty,&rdquo; said Hannibal reassuringly, and they
      hurried forward again. In the utter stillness through which they moved
      Betty heard the beating of her own heart, and the soft, and all but
      inaudible patter of the boy's bare feet on the warm dust of the road.
      Vague forms that resolved themselves into trees and bushes seemed to creep
      toward them out of the night's black uncertainty. Once more Betty paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It were nothing, Miss Betty,&rdquo; said Hannibal as before, and he returned to
      his consideration of the judge. He sensed something of that intellectual
      nimbleness which his patron's physical make-up in nowise suggested, since
      his face was a mask that usually left one in doubt as to just how much of
      what he heard succeeded in making its impression on him; but the boy knew
      that Slocum Price's blind side was a shelterless exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think the carriage could have passed us while we were crossing
      the corn-field?&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I reckon we couldn't a-missed hearing it,&rdquo; answered Hannibal. He had
      scarcely spoken when they caught the rattle of wheels and the beat of
      hoofs. These sounds swept nearer and nearer, and then the darkness
      disgorged the Belle Plain team and carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George!&rdquo; cried Betty, a world of relief in her tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoa, you!&rdquo; and George reined in his horses with a jerk. &ldquo;Who's dar?&rdquo; he
      asked, bending forward on the box as he sought to pierce the darkness with
      his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it you, Missy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I wish you to drive me into Raleigh,&rdquo; said Betty, and she and
      Hannibal entered the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Missy. Yo'-all ready fo' me to go along out o' here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;drive fast, George!&rdquo; urged Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's right dark fo' fas' drivin' Missy, with the road jes' aimin' fo' to
      bus' yo' springs with chuckholes!&rdquo; He had turned his horses' heads in the
      direction of Raleigh while he was speaking. &ldquo;It's scandalous black in
      these heah woods, Missy I 'clar' I never seen it no blacker!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The carriage swung forward for perhaps a hundred yards, then suddenly the
      horses came to a dead stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go along on, dar!&rdquo; cried George, and struck them with his whip, but the
      horses only reared and plunged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, nigger!&rdquo; said a rough voice out of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What yo' doin'?&rdquo; the coachman gasped. &ldquo;Don' yo' know dis de Belle Plain
      carriage? Take yo' han's offen to dem hosses' bits!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two men stepped to the side of the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show your light, Bunker,&rdquo; said the same rough voice that had spoken
      before. Instantly a hooded lantern was uncovered, and Hannibal uttered a
      cry of terror. He was looking into the face of Slosson, the tavern-keeper.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. PRISONERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the face of Betty's indignant protest Slosson and the man named Bunker
      climbed into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you be scared, ma'am,&rdquo; said the tavernkeeper, who smelt strongly of
      whisky. &ldquo;I wouldn't lift my hand ag'in no good looking female except in
      kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you stop my carriage?&rdquo; cried Betty, with a very genuine anger
      which for the moment dominated all her other emotions. She struggled to
      her feet, but Slosson put out a heavy hand and thrust her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now,&rdquo; he urged soothingly. &ldquo;Why make a fuss? We ain't going to harm
      you; we wouldn't for no sum of money. Drive on, Jim&mdash;drive like
      hell!&rdquo; This last was addressed to the man who had taken George's place on
      the box, where a fourth member of Slosson's band had forced the coachman
      down into the narrow space between the seat and dashboard, and was holding
      a pistol to his head while he sternly enjoined silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a word to the horses Jim swung about and the carriage rolled off
      through the night at a breakneck' pace. Betty's shaking hands drew
      Hannibal closer to her side as she felt the surge of her terrors rise
      within her. Who were these men&mdash;where could they be taking her&mdash;and
      for what purpose? The events of the past weeks linked themselves in tragic
      sequence in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it she had to fear? Was it Tom who had inspired Norton's murder?
      Was it Tom for whom these men were acting? Tom who would profit greatly by
      her disappearance or death.
    </p>
    <p>
      They swept past the entrance at Belle Plain, past a break in the wall of
      the forest where the pale light of stars showed Betty the corn-field she
      and Hannibal had but lately crossed, and then on into pitchy darkness
      again. She clung to the desperate hope that they might meet some one on
      the road, when she could cry out and give the alarm. She held herself in
      readiness for this, but there was only the steady pounding of the big bays
      as Jim with voice and whip urged them forward. At last he abruptly checked
      them, and Bunker and Slosson sprang from their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get down, ma'am!&rdquo; said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo; asked Betty, in a voice that shook in spite of
      her efforts to control it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must hurry, ma'am,&rdquo; urged Slosson impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't move until I know where you intend taking me!&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;If I
      am to die&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Slosson laughed loudly and indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't. If you don't want to walk, I'm man enough fo' to tote you. We
      ain't far to go, and I've tackled jobs I'd a heap less heart fo' in my
      time,&rdquo; he concluded gallantly. From the opposite side of the carriage
      Bunker swore nervously. He desired to know if they were to stand there
      talking all night. &ldquo;Shut your filthy mouth, Bunker, and see you keep tight
      hold of that young rip-staver,&rdquo; said Slosson. &ldquo;He's a perfect eel&mdash;I've
      had dealings with him afore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tried to kill my Uncle Bob&mdash;at the tavern, you and Captain
      Murrell. I heard you, and I seen you drag him to the river!&rdquo; cried
      Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slosson gave a start of astonishment at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ain't he hateful?&rdquo; he exclaimed aghast. &ldquo;See here, young feller,
      that's no kind of a way fo' you to talk to a man who has riz his ten
      children!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Bunker swore, while Jim told Slosson to make haste. This popular
      clamor served to recall the tavernkeeper to a sense of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am, like I should tote you, or will you walk?&rdquo; he inquired, and
      reaching out his hand took hold of Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll walk,&rdquo; said the girl quickly, shrinking from the contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep close at my heels. Bunker, you tuck along after her with the boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about this nigger?&rdquo; asked the fourth man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fetch him along with us,&rdquo; said Slosson. They turned from the road while
      he was speaking and entered a narrow path that led off through the woods,
      apparently in the direction of the river. A moment later Betty heard the
      carriage drive away. They went onward in silence for a little time, then
      Slosson spoke over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am, I've riz ten children but none of 'em was like him&mdash;I
      trained 'em up to the minute!&rdquo; Mr. Slosson seemed to have passed
      completely under the spell of his domestic recollections, for he continued
      with just a touch of reminiscent sadness in his tone. &ldquo;There was all told
      four Mrs. Slossons: two of 'em was South Carolinians, one was from
      Georgia, and the last was a widow lady out of east Tennessee. She'd buried
      three husbands and I figured we could start perfectly even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intrinsic fairness of this start made its strong appeal. Mr. Slosson
      dwelt upon it with satisfaction. &ldquo;She had three to her credit, I had three
      to mine; neither could crow none over the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they stumbled forward through the thick obscurity he continued his
      personal revelations, the present enterprise having roused whatever there
      was of sentiment slumbering in his soul. At last they came out on a wide
      bayou; a white mist hung above it, and on the low shore leaf and branch
      were dripping with the night dews. Keeping close to the water's edge
      Slosson led the way to a point where a skiff was drawn up on the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step in, ma'am,&rdquo; he said, when he had launched it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go no farther!&rdquo; said Betty in desperation. She felt an
      overmastering fear, the full horror of the unknown lay hold of her, and
      she gave a piercing cry for help. Slosson swung about on his heel and
      seized her. For a moment she struggled to escape, but the man's big hands
      pinioned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more of that!&rdquo; he warned, then he recovered himself and laughed. &ldquo;You
      could yell till you was black in the face, ma'am, and there'd be no one to
      hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo; and Betty's voice faltered between the sudden
      sobs that choked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just across to George Hicks's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll know in plenty of time.&rdquo; And Slosson leered at her through the
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannibal is to go with me?&rdquo; asked Betty tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; agreed Slosson affably. &ldquo;Your nigger, too&mdash;quite a party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty stepped into the skiff. She felt her hopes quicken&mdash;she was
      thinking of Bess; whatever the girl's motives, she had wished her to
      escape. She would wish it now more than ever since the very thing she had
      striven to prevent had happened. Slosson seated himself and took up the
      oars, Bunker followed with Hannibal and they pushed off. No word was
      spoken until they disembarked on the opposite shore, when Slosson
      addressed Bunker. &ldquo;I reckon I can manage that young rip-staver, you go
      back after Sherrod and the nigger,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He conducted his captives up the bank and they entered a clearing. Looking
      across this Betty saw where a cabin window framed a single square of
      light. They advanced toward this and presently the dark outline of the
      cabin itself became distinguishable. A moment later Slosson paused, a door
      yielded to his hand, and Betty and the boy were thrust into the room where
      Murrell had held his conference with Fentress and Ware. The two women were
      now its only occupants and the mother, gross and shapeless, turned an
      expressionless face on the intruders; but the daughter shrank into the
      shadow, her burning glance fixed on Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's yo' guests, old lady!&rdquo; said Mr. Slosson. Mrs. Hicks rose from the
      three-legged stool on which she was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand me the candle, Bess,&rdquo; she ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one side of the room was a steep flight of stairs which gave access to
      the loft overhead. Mrs. Hicks, by a gesture, signified that Betty and
      Hannibal were to ascend these stairs; they did so and found themselves on
      a narrow landing inclosed by a partition of rough planks, this partition
      was pierced by a low door. Mrs. Hicks, who had followed close at their
      heels, handed the candle to Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In yonder!&rdquo; she said briefly, nodding toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried Betty in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the woman with an almost masculine surliness of tone. &ldquo;I got
      nothing to say.&rdquo; She pushed them into the attic, and, closing the door,
      fastened it with a stout wooden bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond that door, which seemed to have closed on every hope, Betty held
      the tallow dip aloft, and by its uncertain and flickering light surveyed
      her prison. The briefest glance sufficed. The room contained two shakedown
      beds and a stool, there was a window in the gable, but a piece of heavy
      plank was spiked before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Betty, don't you be scared,&rdquo; whispered Hannibal. &ldquo;When the judge
      hears we're gone, him and Mr. Mahaffy will try to find us. They'll go
      right off to Belle Plain&mdash;the judge is always wanting to do that,
      only Mr. Mahaffy never lets him but now he won't be able to stop him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hannibal, Hannibal, what can he do there&mdash;what can any one do
      there?&rdquo; And a dead pallor overspread the girl's face. To speak of the
      blind groping of her friends but served to fix the horror of their
      situation in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Miss Betty, but the judge is always thinking of things to
      do; seems like they was mostly things no one else would ever think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty had placed the candle on the stool and seated herself on one of the
      beds. There was the murmur of voices in the room below; she wondered if
      her fate was under consideration and what that fate was to be. Hannibal,
      who had been examining the window, returned to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Betty, if we could just get out of this loft we could steal their
      skiff and row down to the river; I reckon they got just the one boat; the
      only way they could get to us would be to swim out, and if they done that
      we could pound 'em over the head with the oars the least little thing
      sinks you when you're in the water.&rdquo; But this murderous fancy of his
      failed to interest Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they heard Sherrod and Bunker come up from the shore with
      George. Slosson joined them and there was a brief discussion, then an
      interval of silence, and the sound of voices again as the three white men
      moved back across the field in the direction of the bayou. There succeeded
      a period of utter stillness, both in the cabin and in the clearing, a
      somber hush that plunged Betty yet deeper in despair. Wild thoughts
      assailed her, thoughts against which she struggled with all the strength
      of her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that hour of stress Hannibal was sustained by his faith in the judge.
      He saw his patron's powerful and picturesque intelligence applied to
      solving the mystery of their disappearance from Belle Plain; it was
      inconceivable that this could prove otherwise than disastrous to Mr.
      Slosson and he endeavored to share the confidence he was feeling with
      Betty, but there was something so forced and unnatural in the girl's voice
      and manner when she discussed his conjectures that he quickly fell into an
      awed silence. At last, and it must have been some time after midnight,
      troubled slumbers claimed him. No moment of forgetfulness came to Betty.
      She was waiting for what&mdash;she did not know! The candle burnt lower
      and lower and finally went out and she was left in darkness, but again she
      was conscious of sounds from the room below. At first it was only a word
      or a sentence, then the guarded speech became a steady monotone that ran
      deep into the night; eventually this ceased and Betty fancied she heard
      sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length points of light began to show through chinks in the logs.
      Hannibal roused and sat up, rubbing his eyes with the backs of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't you able to sleep none?&rdquo; he inquired. Betty shook her head. He
      looked at her with an expression of troubled concern. &ldquo;How soon do you
      reckon the judge will know?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very soon now, dear.&rdquo; Hannibal was greatly consoled by this opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Betty, he will love to find us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! What was that?&rdquo; for Betty had caught the distant splash of oars.
      Hannibal found a chink in the logs through which by dint of much squinting
      he secured a partial view of the bayou. &ldquo;They're fetching up a keel boat
      to the shore, Miss Betty&mdash;it's a whooper!&rdquo; he announced. Betty's
      heart sank, she never doubted the purpose for which that boat was brought
      into the bayou, or that it nearly concerned herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Mrs. Hicks appeared with their breakfast. It was in
      vain that Betty attempted to engage her in conversation, either she
      cherished some personal feeling of dislike for her prisoner, or else the
      situation in which she herself was placed had little to recommend it, even
      to her dull mind, and her dissatisfaction was expressed in her attitude
      toward the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty passed the long hours of morning in dreary speculation concerning
      what was happening at Belle Plain. In the end she realized that the day
      could go by and her absence occasion no alarm; Steve might reasonably
      suppose George had driven her into Raleigh or to the Bowens' and that she
      had kept the carriage. Finally all her hope centered on Judge Price. He
      would expect Hannibal during the morning, perhaps when the boy did not
      arrive he would be tempted to go out to Belle Plain to discover the reason
      of his nonappearance. She wondered what theories would offer themselves to
      his ingenious mind, for she sensed something of that indomitable energy
      which in the face of rebuffs and laughter carried him into the thick of
      every sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, Mrs. Hicks, as sullen as in the morning, brought them their
      dinner. She had scarcely quitted the loft when a shrill whistle pierced
      the silence that hung above the clearing. It was twice repeated, and the
      two women were heard to go from the cabin. Perhaps half an hour elapsed,
      then a step became audible on the packed earth of the dooryard; some one
      entered the room below and began to ascend the narrow stairs, and Betty's
      fingers closed convulsively about Hannibal's. This was neither Mrs. Hicks
      nor her daughter, nor Slosson with his clumsy shuffle. There was a brief
      pause when the landing was reached, but it was only momentary; a hand
      lifted the bar, the door was thrown open, and its space framed the figure
      of a man. It was John Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing there he regarded Betty in silence, but a deep-seated fire glowed
      in his sunken eyes. The sense of possession was raging through him, his
      temples throbbed, a fever stirred his blood. Love, such as it was, he
      undoubtedly felt for her and even his giant project with all its monstrous
      ramifications was lost sight of for the moment. She was the inspiration
      for it all, the goal and reward toward which he struggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty!&rdquo; the single word fell softly from his lips. He stepped into the
      room, closing the door as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's eyes were dilating with a mute horror, for by some swift
      intuitive process of the mind, which asked nothing of the logic of events,
      but dealt only with conclusions, Murrell stood revealed as Norton's
      murderer. Perhaps he read her thoughts, but he had lived in his degenerate
      ambitions until the common judgments or the understanding of them no
      longer existed for him. That Betty had loved Norton seemed inconsequential
      even; it was a memory to be swept away by the force of his greater
      passion. So he watched her smilingly, but back of the smile was the menace
      of unleashed impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you find some word of welcome for me, Betty?&rdquo; he asked at length,
      still softly, still with something of entreaty in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was you&mdash;not Tom&mdash;who had me brought here!&rdquo; She could
      have thanked God had it been Tom, whose hate was not to be feared as she
      feared this man's love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom&mdash;no!&rdquo; and Murrell laughed. &ldquo;You didn't think I'd give you up? I
      am standing with a halter, about my neck, and all for your sake&mdash;who'd
      risk as much for love of you?&rdquo; he seemed to expand with savage pride that
      this was so, and took a step toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't come near me!&rdquo; cried Betty. Her eyes blazed, and she looked at him
      with' loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll learn to be kinder,&rdquo; he exulted. &ldquo;You wouldn't see me at Belle
      Plain; what was left for me but to have you brought here?&rdquo; While Murrell
      was speaking, the signal that had told of his own presence on the opposite
      shore of the bayou was heard again. This served to arrest his attention. A
      look of uncertainty passed over his face, then he made an impatient
      gesture as if he dismissed some thought that had forced itself upon him,
      and turned to Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't ask what my purpose is where you are concerned; have you no
      curiosity on that score?&rdquo; She endeavored to meet his glance with a glance
      as resolute, then her eyes sought the boy's upturned face. &ldquo;I am going to
      send you down river, Betty. Later I shall join you in New Orleans, and
      when I leave the country you shall go with me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; gasped Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As my wife, or however you choose to call it. I'll teach you what a man's
      love is like,&rdquo; he boasted, and extended his hand. Betty shrank from him,
      and his hand fell at his side. He looked at her steadily out of his
      deep-sunk eyes in which blazed the fires of his passion, and as he looked,
      her face paled and flushed by turns. &ldquo;You may learn to be kind to me,
      Betty,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You may find it will be worth your while.&rdquo; Betty made no
      answer, she only gathered Hannibal closer to her side. &ldquo;Why not accept
      what I have to offer, Betty?&rdquo; again he went nearer her, and again she
      shrank from him, but the madness of his mood was in the ascendant. He
      seized her and drew her to him. She struggled to free herself, but his
      fingers tightened about hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; she panted. He laughed his cool laugh of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let you go&mdash;ask me anything but that, Betty! Have you no reward for
      patience such as mine? A whole summer has passed since I saw you first&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the noisy shuffling of feet on the stairs, and releasing Betty,
      Murrell swung about on his heel and faced the door. It was pushed open an
      inch at a time by a not too confident hand and Mr. Slosson thus guardedly
      presented himself to the eye of his chief, whom he beckoned from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Murrell, when they stood together on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just come across to the keel boat!&rdquo; and Slosson led the way down the
      stairs and from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you, Joe; you might have waited!&rdquo; observed the outlaw. Slosson gave
      him a hardened grin. They crossed the clearing and boarded the keel boat
      which rested against the bank. As they did so, the cabin in the stern gave
      up a shattered presence in the shape of Tom Ware. Murrell started
      violently. &ldquo;I thought you were hanging out in Memphis, Tom?&rdquo; he said, and
      his brow darkened as, sinister and forbidding, he stepped closer to the
      planter. Ware did not answer at once, but looked at Murrell out of heavy
      bloodshot eyes, his face pinched and ghastly. At last he said, speaking
      with visible effort,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stayed in Memphis until five o'clock this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn your early hours!&rdquo; roared Murrell. &ldquo;What are you doing here? I
      suppose you've been showing that dead face of yours about the neighborhood&mdash;why
      didn't you stay at Belle Plain since you couldn't keep away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been near Belle Plain, I came here instead. How am I going to
      meet people and answer questions?&rdquo; His teeth were chattering. &ldquo;Is it known
      she's missing?&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hicks raised the alarm the first thing this morning, according to the
      instructions I'd given him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; gasped Ware. He was dripping from every pore and the sickly color
      came and went on his unshaven cheeks. Murrell dropped a heavy hand on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't been at Belle Plain, you say, but has any one seen you on the
      road this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one, John,&rdquo; cried Ware, panting between each word. There was a
      moment's pause and Ware spoke again. &ldquo;What are they doing at Belle Plain?&rdquo;
       he demanded in a whisper. Murrell's lips curled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand there is talk of suicide,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are dragging the bayou down below the house. It looks as though you
      were going to reap the rewards of the excellent management you have given
      her estate. They have been trying to find you in Memphis, so the sooner
      you show yourself the better,&rdquo; he concluded significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure you have her safe, John, no chance of discovery? For God's
      sake, get her away from here as soon as you can, it's an awful risk you
      run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll be sent down river to-night,&rdquo; said Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; began Slosson who up to this had taken no part in the
      conversation. &ldquo;When are you going to cross to t'other side of the bayou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; replied Murrell. Slosson laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know but you'd clean forgot the Clan's business. I want to ask
      another question&mdash;but first I want to say that no one thinks higher
      or more frequent of the ladies than just me, I'm genuinely fond of 'em and
      I've never lifted my hand ag'in' 'em except in kindness.&rdquo; Mr. Slosson
      looked at Ware with an exceedingly virtuous expression of countenance. He
      continued. &ldquo;Yo' orders are that we're to slip out of this a little afore
      midnight, but suppose there's a hitch&mdash;here's the lady knowing what
      she knows and here's the boy knowing what he knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no hitch,&rdquo; rasped out Murrell arrogantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew a speculation that couldn't go wrong; and by rights we
      should have got away last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whose fault is it you didn't?&rdquo; demanded Murrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a manner it were mine, but the ark got on a sandbank as we were
      fetching it in and it took us the whole damn night to get clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; prompted Murrell, with a sullen frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose they get shut of that notion of theirs that the lady's done
      drowned herself, suppose they take to watching the river? Or suppose the
      whole damn bottom drops out of this deal? What then? Why, I'll tell you
      what then&mdash;the lady, good looking as she is, knows enough to make
      west Tennessee mighty onhealthy for some of us. I say suppose it's a flash
      in the pan and you have to crowd the distance in between you and this part
      of the world, you can't tell me you'll have any use for her then.&rdquo; Slosson
      paused impressively. &ldquo;And here's Mr. Ware feeling bad, feeling like hell,&rdquo;
       he resumed. &ldquo;Him and me don't want to be left in no trap with you gone God
      only knows where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send a man to take charge of the keel boat. I can't risk any more of
      your bungling, Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, but you don't answer my question,&rdquo; persisted Slosson,
      with admirable tenacity of purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your question, Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot can happen between this and midnight&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If things go wrong with us there'll be a blaze at the head of the bayou;
      does that satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Murrell hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the girl?&rdquo; insisted Slosson, dragging him back to the point at
      issue between them. &ldquo;As a man I wouldn't lift my hand ag'in' no good
      looking woman except like I said&mdash;in kindness, but she can't be
      turned loose, she knows too much. What's the word, Captain&mdash;you say
      it!&rdquo; he urged. He made a gesture of appeal to Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look for the light; better still, look for the man I'll send.&rdquo; And with
      this Murrell would have turned away, but Slosson detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'll he be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some fellow who knows the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it's the light?&rdquo; asked the tavern-keeper in a hoarse undertone.
      Again he looked toward Ware, who, dry-lipped and ashen, was regarding him
      steadfastly. Glance met glance, for a brief instant they looked deep into
      each other's eyes and then the hand Slosson had rested on Murrell's
      shoulder dropped at his side.

      CHAPTER XXVIII. THE JUDGE MEETS THE SITUATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The judge's and Mr. Mahaffy's celebration of the former's rehabilitated
      credit had occupied the shank of the evening, the small hours of the
      night, and that part of the succeeding day which the southwest described
      as soon in the morning; and as the stone jug, in which were garnered the
      spoils of the highly confidential but entirely misleading conversation
      which the judge had held with Mr. Pegloe after his return from Belle
      Plain, lost in weight, it might have been observed that he and Mr. Mahaffy
      seemed to gain in that nice sense of equity which should form the basis of
      all human relations. The judge watched Mr. Mahaffy, and Mr. Mahaffy
      watched the judge, each trustfully placing the regulation of his private
      conduct in the hands of his friend, as the one most likely to be affected
      by the rectitude of his acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably so extensive a consumption of Mr. Pegloe's corn whisky had never
      been accomplished with greater highmindedness. They honorably split the
      last glass, the judge scorning to set up any technical claim to it as his
      exclusive property; then he stared at Mahaffy, while Mahaffy, dark-visaged
      and forbidding, stared back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge sighed deeply. He took up the jug and inverted it. A stray drop
      or so fell languidly into his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try squeezing it, Price,&rdquo; said Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge shook the jug, it gave forth an empty sound, and he sighed
      again; he attempted to peer into it, closing one watery eye as he tilted
      it toward the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder no Yankee has ever thought to invent a jug with a glass bottom,&rdquo;
       he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You astonish me, Solomon,&rdquo; exclaimed the judge. &ldquo;Coming as you do from
      that section which invented the wooden nutmeg, and an eight-day clock that
      has been known to run as much as four or five hours at a stretch. I am
      aware the Yankees are an ingenious people; I wonder none of 'em ever
      thought of a jug with a glass bottom, so that when a body holds it up to
      the light he can see at a glance whether it is empty or not. Do you reckon
      Pegloe has sufficient confidence to fill the jug again for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mahaffy's expression indicated no great confidence in Mr. Pegloe's
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Credit,&rdquo; began the judge, &ldquo;is proverbially shy; still it may sometimes be
      increased, like the muscles of the body and the mental faculties, by
      judicious use. I've always regarded Pegloe as a cheap mind. I hope I have
      done him an injustice.&rdquo; He put on his hat, and tucking the jug under his
      arm, went from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten or fifteen minutes elapsed. Mahaffy considered this a good sign, it
      didn't take long to say no, he reflected. Another ten or fifteen elapsed.
      Mahaffy lost heart. Then there came a hasty step beyond the door, it was
      thrown violently open, and the judge precipitated himself into the room. A
      glance showed Mahaffy that he was laboring under intense excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon, I bring shocking news. God knows what the next few hours may
      reveal!&rdquo; cried the judge, mopping his brow. &ldquo;Miss Malroy has disappeared
      from Belle Plain, and Hannibal has gone with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have they gone?&rdquo; asked Mahaffy, and his long jaw dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God I had an answer ready for that question, Solomon!&rdquo; answered
      the judge, with a melancholy shake of the head. He gazed down on his
      friend with an air of large tolerance. &ldquo;I am going to Belle Plain, but you
      are too drunk. Sleep it off, Solomon, and join me when your brain is clear
      and your legs steady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy jerked out an oath, and lifting himself off his chair, stood
      erect. He snatched up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff your pistols into your pockets, and come on, Price!&rdquo; he said, and
      stalked toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flitted up the street, and the judge puffed and panted in his wake.
      They gained the edge of the village without speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is mystery and rascality here!&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know, Price, and where did you hear this?&rdquo; Mahaffy shot the
      question back over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Pegloe's, the Belle Plain overseer had just fetched the news into
      town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again they were silent, all their energies being absorbed by the physical
      exertion they were making. The road danced before their burning eyes, it
      seemed to be uncoiling itself serpentwise with hideous undulations. Mr.
      Mahaffy was conscious that the judge, of whom he caught a blurred vision
      now at his right side, now at his left, was laboring painfully in the heat
      and dust, the breath whistling from between his parched lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're just ripe for apoplexy, Price!&rdquo; he snarled, moderating his pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said the judge, with stolid resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two miles out of the village they came to a roadside spring, here they
      paused for an instant. Mahaffy scooped up handfuls of the clear water and
      sucked it down greedily. The judge dropped on his stomach and buried his
      face in the tiny pool, gulping up great thirsty swallows. After a long
      breathless instant he stood erect, with drops of moisture clinging to his
      nose and eyebrows. Mahaffy was a dozen paces down the road, hurrying
      forward again with relentless vigor. The judge shuffled after him. The
      tracks they left in the dust crossed and re-crossed the road, but
      presently the slanting lines of their advance straightened, the judge
      gained and held a fixed place at Mahaffy's right, a step or so in the
      rear. His oppulent fancy began to deal with the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If anything happens to the child, the man responsible for it would better
      never been born&mdash;I'll pursue him with undiminished energy from this
      moment forth!&rdquo; he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could happen to him, Price?&rdquo; asked Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, poor little lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you shut up!&rdquo; cried Mahaffy savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you go building on that idea? Why should any one harm him&mdash;what
      earthly purpose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Solomon, we are the pivotal point in a vast circle of crime.
      This is a blow at me&mdash;this is revenge, sir, neither more nor less!
      They have struck at me through the boy, it is as plain as day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did the overseer say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that they found Miss Malroy gone from Belle Plain this morning, and
      the boy with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is like you, Price! How do you know they haven't spent the night at
      some neighbor's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The nearest neighbor is five or six miles distant. Miss Malroy and
      Hannibal were seen along about dusk in the grounds at Belle Plain, do you
      mean to tell me you consider it likely that they set out on foot at that
      hour, and without a word to any one, to make a visit?&rdquo; inquired the judge;
      but Mahaffy did not contend for this point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do first, Price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a look over the grounds, and talk with the slaves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the brother&mdash;wasn't he at Belle Plain last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems he went to Memphis yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They plodded forward in silence; now and again they were passed by some
      man on horseback whose destination was the same as their own, and then at
      last they caught sight of Belle Plain in its grove of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      All work on the plantation had stopped, and the hundreds of slaves&mdash;men,
      women and children&mdash;were gathered about the house. Among these moved
      the members of the dominant race. The judge would have attached himself to
      the first group, but he heard a whispered question, and the answer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Malroy's lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clearly it was not for him to mix with these outsiders, these curiosity
      seekers. He crossed the lawn to the house, and mounted the steps. In the
      doorway was big Steve, while groups of men stood about in the hall, the
      hum of busy purposeless talk pervading the place. The judge frowned. This
      was all wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Ware returned from Memphis?&rdquo; he asked of Steve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sah; not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then show me into the library,&rdquo; said the judge with bland authority,
      surrendering his hat to the butler. &ldquo;Come along, Mahaffy!&rdquo; he added. They
      entered the library, and the judge motioned Steve to close the door. &ldquo;Now,
      boy, you'll kindly ask those people to withdraw&mdash;you may say it is
      Judge Price's orders. Allow no one to enter the house unless they have
      business with me, or as I send for them&mdash;you understand? After you
      have cleared the house, you may bring me a decanter of corn whisky&mdash;stop
      a bit&mdash;you may ask the sheriff to step here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sah.&rdquo; And Steve withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge drew an easy-chair up to the flat-topped desk that stood in the
      center of the room, and seated himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to make this the excuse for another drunk, Price? If so, I
      feel the greatest contempt for you,&rdquo; said Mahaffy sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge winced at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made a regrettable choice of words, Solomon,&rdquo; he urged gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's your feeling for the boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said the judge, with an eloquent gesture, resting his hand on his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you let whisky alone, I'll believe you, otherwise what I have said
      must stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door opened, and the sheriff slouched into the room. He was chewing a
      long wheat straw, and his whole appearance was one of troubled weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; he said briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Sheriff,&rdquo; and the judge indicated a meek seat for the official
      in a distant corner. &ldquo;Have you learned anything?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you turning all these neighbors out of doors for?&rdquo; he questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't want people tracking in and out the house, Sheriff. Important
      evidence may be destroyed. I propose examining the slaves first&mdash;does
      that meet with your approval?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've talked with them, they don't know nothing,&rdquo; said the sheriff.
      &ldquo;No one don't know nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please God, we may yet put our fingers on some villain who does,&rdquo; said
      the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside it was noised about that judge Price had taken matters in hand&mdash;he
      was the old fellow who had been warned to keep his mouth shut, and who had
      never stopped talking since. A crowd collected beyond the library windows
      and feasted its eyes on the back of this hero's bald head.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the house servants were ushered into the judge's presence.
      First he interrogated little Steve, who had gone to Miss Betty's door that
      morning to rouse her, as was his custom. Next he examined Betty's maid;
      then the cook, and various house servants, who had nothing especial to
      tell, but told it at considerable length; and lastly big Steve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; the judge suddenly interrupted the butler in the midst of
      his narrative. &ldquo;Does the overseer always come up to the house the first
      thing in the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, not exactly, Sah, but he come up this mo'ning, Sah. He was talking
      to me at the back of the house, when the women run out with the word that
      Missy was done gone away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He joined in the search?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sah.''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was Miss Malroy seen last?&rdquo; asked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She and the young gemman you fotched heah were seen in the gyarden along
      about sundown. I seen them myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had had supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who sleeps here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just little Steve and three of the women, they sleeps at the back of the
      house, Sah.''
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sounds were heard during the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see the overseer&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;Hicks? Suppose you go
      for him!&rdquo; said the judge, addressing the sheriff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheriff was gone from the room only a few moments, and returned with
      the information that Hicks was down at the bayou, which was to be dragged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hicks says Miss Malroy's been acting mighty queer ever since Charley
      Norton was shot&mdash;distracted like! He says he noticed it, and that Tom
      Ware noticed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he explain the boy's disappearance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He reckons she throwed herself in, and the boy tried to drag her out,
      like he naturally would, and got drawed in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! I'll trouble Mr. Hicks to step here,&rdquo; said the judge quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Mr. Carrington and a couple of strangers outside who've been
      asking about Miss Malroy and the boy, seems like the strangers knowed her
      and him back yonder in No'th Carolina,&rdquo; said the sheriff as he turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see them.&rdquo; The sheriff went from the room and the judge dismissed
      the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think, Price?&rdquo; asked Mahaffy anxiously when they were
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! Take my word for it, Solomon, this blow is leveled at me. I have
      been too forward in my attempts to suppress the carnival of crime that is
      raging through west Tennessee. You'll observe that Miss Malroy disappeared
      at a moment when the public is disposed to think she has retained me as
      her legal adviser, probably she will be set at liberty when she agrees to
      drop the matter of Norton's murder. As for the boy, they'll use him to
      compel my silence and inaction.&rdquo; The judge took a long breath. &ldquo;Yet there
      remains one point where the boy is concerned that completely baffles me.
      If we knew just a little more of his antecedents it might cause me to make
      a startling and radical move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy was clearly not impressed by the vague generalities in which the
      judge was dealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go, Price, as usual, trying to convince yourself that you are
      the center of everything!&rdquo; he said, in a tone of much exasperation. &ldquo;Let's
      get down to business! What does this man Hicks mean by hinting at suicide?
      You saw Miss Malroy yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have put your finger on a point of some significance,&rdquo; said the
      judge. &ldquo;She bore evidence of the shock and loss she had sustained; aside
      from that she was quite as she has always been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you want to see Hicks for? What do you expect to learn from
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like his insistence on the idea that Miss Malroy is mentally
      unbalanced. It's a question of some delicacy&mdash;the law, sir, fully
      recognizes that. It seems to me he is overanxious to account for her
      disappearance in a manner that can compromise no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here they were interrupted by the opening of the door, and big Steve
      admitted Carrington and the two men of whom the sheriff had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shocking condition of affairs, Mr. Carrington!&rdquo; said the judge by way
      of greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carrington shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You left these parts some time ago, I believe?&rdquo; continued the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The day before Norton was shot. I had started home for Kentucky. I heard
      of his death when I reached Randolph on the second bluff,&rdquo; explained
      Carrington, from whose cheeks the weather-beaten bloom had faded. He
      rested his hand on the edge of the desk and turned to the men who had
      followed him into the room. &ldquo;This is the gentleman you wish to see,&rdquo; he
      said, and stepped to one of the windows; it overlooked the terraces where
      he had said good-by to Betty scarcely a week before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men had paused by the door. They now advanced. One was gaunt and
      haggard, his face disfigured by a great red scar, the other was a
      shockheaded individual who moved with a shambling gait. Both carried
      rifles and both were dressed in coarse homespun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, sir,&rdquo; said the man with the scar. &ldquo;Yancy's my name, and this
      gentleman 'lows he'd rather be known now as Mr. Cavendish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge started to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob Yancy?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, that's me.&rdquo; The judge passed nimbly around the desk and shook
      the Scratch Hiller warmly by the hand. &ldquo;Where's my nevvy, sir&mdash;what's
      all this about him and Miss Betty?&rdquo; Yancy's soft drawl was suddenly eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please God we'll recover him soon!&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the window Carrington moved impatiently. No harm could come to the boy,
      but Betty&mdash;a shudder went through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've stolen him.&rdquo; Yancy spoke with conviction. &ldquo;I reckon they've
      started back to No'th Carolina with him&mdash;only that don't explain
      what's come of Miss Betty, does it?&rdquo; and he dropped rather helplessly into
      a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob are just getting off a sick bed. He's been powerful porely in
      consequence of having his head laid open and then being throwed into the
      Elk River, where I fished him out,&rdquo; explained Cavendish, who still
      continued to regard the judge with unmixed astonishment, first cocking his
      shaggy head on one side and then on the other, his bleached eyes narrowed
      to a slit. Now and then he favored the austere Mahaffy with a fleeting
      glance. He seemed intuitively to understand the comradeship of their
      degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cavendish fetched me here on his raft. We tied up to the sho' this
      morning. It was there we met Mr. Carrington&mdash;I'd knowed him slightly
      back yonder in No'th Carolina,&rdquo; continued Yancy. &ldquo;He said I'd find
      Hannibal with you. I was counting a heap on seeing my nevvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington, no longer able to control himself, swung about on his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's been done?&rdquo; he asked, with fierce repression. &ldquo;What's going to be
      done? Don't you know that every second is precious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am about to conclude my investigations, sir,&rdquo; said the judge with
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington stepped to the door. After all, what was there to expect of
      these men? Whatever their interest, it was plainly centered in the boy. He
      passed out into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed on him the judge turned again to the Scratch Hiller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Yancy, Mr. Mahaffy and I hold your nephew in the tenderest regard, he
      has been our constant companion ever since you were lost to him. In this
      crisis you may rely upon us; we are committed to his recovery, no matter
      what it involves.&rdquo; The judge's tone was one of unalterable resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you-all have been mighty good and kind to him,&rdquo; said Yancy
      huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have endeavored to be, Mr. Yancy&mdash;indeed I had formed the
      resolution legally to adopt him should you not come to claim him. I should
      have given him my name, and made him my heir. His education has already
      begun, under my supervision,&rdquo; and the judge, remembering the high use to
      which he had dedicated one of Pegloe's trade labels, fairly glowed with
      philanthropic fervor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of that!&rdquo; murmured Yancy softly. He was deeply moved. So was Mr.
      Cavendish, who was gifted with a wealth of ready sympathy. He thrust out a
      hardened hand to the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You're a heap better than you look.&rdquo; A thin ripple of
      laughter escaped Mahaffy, but the judge accepted Chills and Fever's
      proffered hand. He understood that here was a simple genuine soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price, isn't it important for us to know why Mr. Yancy thinks the boy has
      been taken back to North Carolina?&rdquo; said Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what kin is Hannibal to you, Mr. Yancy?&rdquo; asked the judge resuming
      his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strictly speaking, he ain't none. That he come to live with me is all
      owing to Mr. Crenshaw, who's a good man when left to himself, but he's got
      a wife, so a body may say he never is left to himself,&rdquo; began Yancy; and
      then briefly he told the story of the woman and the child much as he had
      told it to Bladen at the Barony the day of General Quintard's funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge, his back to the light and his face in shadow, rested his left
      elbow on the desk and with his chin sunk in his palm, followed the Scratch
      Hiller's narrative with the closest attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And General Quintard never saw him&mdash;never manifested any interest in
      him?&rdquo; the words came slowly from the judge's lips, he seemed to gulp down
      something that rose in his throat. &ldquo;Poor little lad!&rdquo; he muttered, and
      again, &ldquo;Poor little lad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never once, sir. He told the slaves to keep him out of his sight. We-all
      wondered, fo' you know how niggers will talk. We thought maybe he was some
      kin to the Quintards, but we couldn't figure out how. The old general
      never had but one child and she had been dead fo' years. The child
      couldn't have been hers no how.&rdquo; Yancy paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge drummed idly on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What implacable hate&mdash;what iron pride!&rdquo; he murmured, and swept his
      hand across his eyes. Absorbed and aloof, he was busy with his thoughts
      that spanned the waste of years, years that seemed to glide before him in
      review, each bitter with its hideous memories of shame and defeat. Then
      from the smoke of these lost battles emerged the lonely figure of the
      child as he had seen him that June night. His ponderous arm stiffened
      where it rested on the desk, he straightened up in his chair and his face
      assumed its customary expression of battered dignity, while a smile at
      once wistful and tender hovered about his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One other question,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Until this man Murrell appeared you had no
      trouble with Bladen? He was content that you should keep the child&mdash;your
      right to Hannibal was never challenged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, sir. All my troubles began about that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murrell belongs in these parts,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd admire fo' to meet him,&rdquo; said Yancy quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I place my professional services at your disposal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yours is a
      clear case of felonious assault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it ain't, sir&mdash;I look at it this-a-ways; it's a clear case of my
      giving him the damnedest sort of a body beating!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;I'll hold your hat while you are about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hicks had taken his time in responding to the judge's summons, but now his
      step sounded in the hall and throwing open the door he entered the room.
      Whether consciously or not he had acquired something of that surly,
      forbidding manner which was characteristic of his employer. A curt nod of
      the head was his only greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you sit down?&rdquo; asked the judge. Hicks signified by another movement
      of the head that he would not. &ldquo;This is a very dreadful business!&rdquo; began
      the judge softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't it?&rdquo; agreed Hicks. &ldquo;What you got to say to me?&rdquo; he added
      petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you started to drag the bayou?&rdquo; asked the judge. Hicks nodded. &ldquo;That
      was your idea?&rdquo; suggested the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wa'n't,&rdquo; objected Hicks quickly. &ldquo;But I said she had been actin'
      like she was plumb distracted ever since Charley Norton got shot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired the judge, arching his eyebrows. Hicks was plainly
      disturbed by the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sort of out of her head. Mr. Ware seen it, too&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; him and me discussed it together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge regarded Hicks long and intently and in, silence. His
      magnificent mind was at work. If Betty had been distraught he had not
      observed any sign of it the previous day. If Ware were better informed as
      to her true mental state why had he chosen this time to go to Memphis?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Mr. Ware asked you to keep an eye on Miss Malroy while he was
      away from home?&rdquo; said the judge. Hicks, suspicious of the drift of his
      questioning, made no answer. &ldquo;I suppose you told the house servants to
      keep her under observation?&rdquo; continued the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't talk to no niggers,&rdquo; replied Hicks, &ldquo;except to give 'em my
      orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did you give them that order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden and hurried entrance of big Steve brought the judge's
      examination of Mr. Hicks to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mas'r, you know dat 'ar coachman George&mdash;the big black fellow dat
      took you into town las' evenin'? I jes' been down at Shanty Hill whar
      Milly, his wife, is carryin' on something scandalous 'cause George ain't
      never come home!&rdquo; Steve was laboring under intense excitement, but he
      ignored the presence of the overseer and addressed himself to Slocum
      Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo; cried Hicks quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar warn't no George, mind you, Mas'r, but dar was his team in de stable
      this mo'ning and lookin' mighty nigh done up with hard driving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; interrupted Hicks uneasily; &ldquo;put a pair of lines in a nigger's
      hands and he'll run any team off its legs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' the kerriage all scratched up from bein' thrashed through the
      bushes,&rdquo; added Steve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a nigger for you!&rdquo; said Hicks. &ldquo;She took the rascal out of the
      field, dressed him like he was a gentleman and pampered him up, and now
      first chance he gets he runs off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the judge softly. &ldquo;Then you knew this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I knew&mdash;wa'n't it my business to know? I reckon he was off
      skylarking, and when he'd seen the mess he'd made, the trifling fool took
      to the woods. Well, he catches it when I lay hands on him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know when and under what circumstances the team was stabled, Mr.
      Hicks?&rdquo; inquired the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't, but I reckon it must have been along after dark,&rdquo; said Hicks
      unwillingly. &ldquo;I seen to the feeding just after sundown like I always do,
      then I went to supper,&rdquo; Hicks vouchsafed to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no one saw or heard the team drive in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as I know of,&rdquo; said Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mas'r Ca'ington's done gone off to get a pack of dawgs&mdash;he 'lows
      hit's might' important to find what's come of George,&rdquo; said Steve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hicks started violently at this piece of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he'll have to travel a right smart distance to find a pack of
      dogs,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I don't know of none this side of Colonel Bates' down
      below Girard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge was lost in thought. He permitted an interval of silence to
      elapse in which Hicks' glance slid round in a furtive circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did Mr. Ware set out for Memphis?&rdquo; asked the judge at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Early yesterday. He goes there pretty often on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talked with Mr. Ware before he left?&rdquo; Hicks nodded. &ldquo;Did he speak of
      Miss Malroy?&rdquo; Hicks shook his head. &ldquo;Did you see her during the
      afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;maybe you think these niggers ain't enough to keep a man
      stirring?&rdquo; said Hicks uneasily and with a scowl. The judge noticed both
      the uneasiness and the scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should imagine they would absorb every moment of your time, Mr. Hicks,&rdquo;
       he agreed affably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man's got to be a hog for work to hold a job like mine,&rdquo; said Hicks
      sourly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it came to your notice that Miss Malroy has been in a disturbed
      mental state ever since Mr. Norton's murder? I am interested in this
      point, Mr. Hicks, because your experience is so entirely at variance with
      my own. It was my privilege to see and speak with her yesterday afternoon;
      I was profoundly impressed by her naturalness and composure.&rdquo; The judge
      smiled, then he leaned forward across the desk. &ldquo;What were you doing up
      here early this morning&mdash;hasn't a hog for work like you got any
      business of his own at that hour?&rdquo; The judge's tone was suddenly
      offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, what right have you got to try and pump me?&rdquo; cried Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      For no discernible reason Mr. Cavendish spat on his palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hicks,&rdquo; said the judge, urbane and gracious, &ldquo;I believe in
      frankness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Hicks, mollified by the judge's altered tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore I do not hesitate to say that I consider you a damned
      scoundrel!&rdquo; concluded the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cavendish, accepting the judge's ultimatum as something which must
      debar Hicks from all further consideration, and being, as he was,
      exceedingly active and energetic by nature, if one passed over the various
      forms of gainful industry, uttered a loud whoop and threw himself on the
      overseer. There was a brief struggle and Hicks went down with the Earl of
      Lambeth astride of him; then from his boot leg that knightly soul flashed
      a horn-handled tickler of formidable dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge, Yancy, and Mahaffy, sprang from their chairs. Mr. Mahaffy was
      plainly shocked at the spectacle of Mr. Cavendish's lawless violence.
      Yancy was disturbed too, but not by the moral aspects of the case; he was
      doubtful as to just how his friend's act would appeal to the judge. He
      need not have been distressed on that score, since the judge's one idea
      was to profit by it. With his hands on his knees he was now bending above
      the two men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to know, judge?&rdquo; cried Cavendish, panting from his
      exertions. &ldquo;I'll learn this parrot to talk up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hicks,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;it is in your power to tell us a few things we
      are here to find out.&rdquo; Hicks looked up into the judge's face and closed
      his lips grimly. &ldquo;Mr. Cavendish, kindly let him have the point of that
      large knife where he'll feel it most!&rdquo; ordered the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk quick!&rdquo; said Cavendish with a ferocious scowl. &ldquo;Talk&mdash;or what's
      to hinder me slicing open your woozen?&rdquo; and he pressed the blade of his
      knife against the overseer's throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about Miss Betty,&rdquo; said Hicks in a sullen whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you don't, but what do you know about the boy?&rdquo; Hicks was silent,
      but he was grateful for the judge's question. From Tom Ware he had learned
      of Fentress' interest in the boy. Why should he shelter the colonel at
      risk to himself? &ldquo;If you please, Mr. Cavendish!&rdquo; said the judge quietly
      nodding toward the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't ask me about him,&rdquo; said Hicks quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do now,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was here yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Cavendish&mdash;&rdquo; and again the judge glanced toward the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried Hicks. &ldquo;You go to Colonel Fentress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him up, Mr. Cavendish; that's all we want to mow,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX. COLONEL FENTRESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The judge had not forgotten his ghost, the ghost he had seen in Mr. Saul's
      office that day he went to the court-house on business for Charley Norton.
      Working or idling&mdash;principally the latter&mdash;drunk or sober&mdash;principally
      the former&mdash;the ghost, otherwise Colonel Fentress, had preserved a
      place in his thoughts, and now as he moved stolidly up the drive toward
      Fentress' big white house on the hill with Mahaffy, Cavendish, and Yancy
      trailing in his wake, memories of what had once been living and vital
      crowded in upon him. Some sense of the wreck that littered the long years,
      and the shame of the open shame that had swept away pride and
      self-respect, came back to him out of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only paused when he stood on the portico before Fentress' open door. He
      glanced about him at the wide fields, bounded by the distant timber lands
      that hid gloomy bottoms, at the great log barns in the hollow to his
      right; at the huddle of whitewashed cabins beyond; then with his big fist
      he reached in and pounded on the door. The blows echoed loudly through the
      silent house, and an instant later Fentress' tall, spare figure was seen
      advancing from the far end of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Price&mdash;Colonel Fentress'' said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Price,&rdquo; uncertainly, and still advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had flattered myself that you must have heard of me,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have,&rdquo; said Fentress, pausing now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks he has!&rdquo; muttered the judge under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come in?&rdquo; it was more a question than an invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are at liberty.&rdquo; The colonel bowed. &ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; the judge
      continued. &ldquo;Colonel Fentress&mdash;Mr. Mahaffy, Mr. Yancy and Mr.
      Cavendish.&rdquo; Again the colonel bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you step into the library?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; and the judge followed the colonel briskly down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they entered the library Fentress turned and took stock of his
      guests. Mahaffy he had seen before; Yancy and Cavendish were of course
      strangers to him, but their appearance explained them; last of all his
      glance shifted to the judge. He had heard something of those activities by
      means of which Slocum Price had striven to distinguish himself, and he had
      a certain curiosity respecting the man. It was immediately satisfied. The
      judge had reached a degree of shabbiness seldom equaled, and but for his
      mellow, effulgent personality might well have passed for a common
      vagabond; and if his dress advertised the state of his finances, his face
      explained his habits. No misconception was possible about either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I offer you a glass of liquor?&rdquo; asked Fentress, breaking the silence.
      He stepped to the walnut centertable where there was a decanter and
      glasses. By a gesture the judge declined the invitation. Whereat the
      colonel looked surprised, but not so surprised as Mahaffy. There was
      another silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think we ever met before?&rdquo; observed Fentress. There was something
      in the fixed stare his visitor was bending upon him that he found
      disquieting, just why, he could not have told.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that fixed stare of the judge's continued. No, the man had not changed&mdash;he
      had grown older certainly, but age had not come ungracefully; he became
      the glossy broadcloth and spotless linen he wore. Here was a man who could
      command the good things of life, using them with a rational temperance.
      The room itself was in harmony with his character; it was plain but rich
      in its appointments, at once his library and his office, while the
      well-filled cases ranged about the walls showed his tastes to be in the
      main scholarly and intellectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you lived here?&rdquo; asked the judge abruptly. Fentress seemed
      to hesitate; but the judge's glance, compelling and insistent, demanded an
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have known many men of all classes as a lawyer and a planter?&rdquo; said
      the judge. Fentress inclined his head. The judge took a step nearer him.
      &ldquo;People have a great trick of coming and going in these western states&mdash;all
      sorts of damned riffraff drift in and out of these new lands.&rdquo; A deadly
      earnestness lifted the judge's words above mere rudeness. Fentress, cold
      and distant, made no reply. &ldquo;For the past twenty years I have been looking
      for a man by the name of Gatewood&mdash;David Gatewood.&rdquo; Disciplined as he
      was, the colonel started violently. &ldquo;Ever heard of him, Fentress?&rdquo;
       demanded the judge with a savage scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this to me?&rdquo; The words came with a gasp from Fentress'
      twitching lips. The judge looked at him moody and frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reason to think this man Gatewood came to west Tennessee,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so, I have never heard of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not under that name&mdash;at any rate you are going to hear of
      him now. This man Gatewood, who between ourselves was a damned scoundrel&rdquo;&mdash;the
      colonel winced&mdash;&ldquo;this man Gatewood had a friend who threw money and
      business in his way&mdash;a planter he was, same as Gatewood. A sort of
      partnership existed between the pair. It proved an expensive enterprise
      for Gatewood's friend, since he came to trust the damned scoundrel more
      and more as time passed&mdash;even large sums of his money were in
      Gatewood's hands&mdash;&rdquo; the judge paused. Fentress' countenance was like
      stone, as expressionless and as rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the door stood Mahaffy with Yancy and Cavendish; they understood that
      what was obscure and meaningless to them held a tragic significance to
      these two men. The judge's heavy face, ordinarily battered and debauched,
      but infinitely good-natured, bore now the markings of deep passion, and
      the voice that rumbled forth from his capacious chest came to their ears
      like distant thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This friend of Gatewood's had a wife&mdash;&rdquo; The judge's voice broke,
      emotion shook him like a leaf, he was tearing open his wounds. He reached
      over and poured himself a drink, sucking it down with greedy lips. &ldquo;There
      was a wife&mdash;&rdquo; he whirled about on his heel and faced Fentress again.
      &ldquo;There was a wife, Fentress&mdash;&rdquo; he fixed Fentress with his blazing
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wife and child. Well, one day Gatewood and the wife were missing. Under
      the circumstances Gatewood's friend was well rid of the pair&mdash;he
      should have been grateful, but he wasn't, for his wife took his child, a
      daughter; and Gatewood a trifle of thirty thousand dollars his friend had
      intrusted to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At a later day I met this man who had been betrayed by his wife and
      robbed by his friend. He had fallen out of the race&mdash;drink had done
      for him&mdash;there was just one thing he seemed to care about and that
      was the fate of his child, but maybe he was only curious there. He
      wondered if she had lived, and married&mdash;&rdquo; Once more the judge paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's all this to me?&rdquo; asked Fentress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure it's nothing to you?&rdquo; demanded the judge hoarsely.
      &ldquo;Understand this, Fentress. Gatewood's treachery brought ruin to at least
      two lives. It caused the woman's father to hide his face from the world,
      it wasn't enough for him that his friends believed his daughter dead; he
      knew differently and the shame of that knowledge ate into his soul. It
      cost the husband his place in the world, too&mdash;in the end it made of
      him a vagabond and a penniless wanderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is nothing to me,&rdquo; said Fentress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried the judge. &ldquo;About six years ago the woman was seen at her
      father's home in North Carolina. I reckon Gatewood had cast her off. She
      didn't go back empty-handed. She had run away from her husband with a
      child&mdash;a girl; after a lapse of twenty years she returned to her
      father with a boy of two or three. There are two questions that must be
      answered when I find Gatewood: what became of the woman and what became of
      the child; are they living or dead; did the daughter grow up and marry and
      have a son? When I get my answer it will be time enough to think of
      Gatewood's punishment!&rdquo; The judge leaned forward across the table,
      bringing his face close to Fentress' face. &ldquo;Look at me&mdash;do you know
      me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fentress' expression never altered. The judge fell back a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fentress, I want the boy,&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mad! What do I know of him&mdash;or you?&rdquo; Fentress was gaining
      courage from the sound of his own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know who he is and where he is. Your business relations with General
      Ware have put you on the track of the Quintard lands in this state. You
      intend to use the boy to gather them in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're mad!&rdquo; repeated Fentress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless you bring him to me inside of twenty-four hours I'll smash you!&rdquo;
       roared the judge. &ldquo;Your name isn't Fentress, it's Gatewood; you've stolen
      the name of Fentress, just as you have stolen other things. What's come of
      Turberville's wife and child? What's come of Turberville's money? Damn
      your soul! I want my grandson! I'll pull you down and leave you stripped
      and bare! I'll tell the world the false friend you've been&mdash;the thief
      you are! I'll strip you and turn you out of these doors as naked as when
      you entered the world!&rdquo; The judge seemed to tower above Fentress, the man
      had shot up out of his deep debasement. &ldquo;Choose! Choose!&rdquo; he thundered,
      his shaggy brows bent in a menacing frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about the boy,&rdquo; said Fentress slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, you lie!&rdquo; stormed the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about the boy,&rdquo; and Fentress took a step toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay where you are!&rdquo; commanded the judge. &ldquo;If you attempt to leave this
      room to call your niggers I'll kill you on its threshold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Yancy and Cavendish had stepped to the door with an intention that was
      evident, and Fentress' thin face cast itself in haggard lines. He was
      feeling the judge's terrible capacity, his unexpected ability to deal with
      a supreme situation. Even Mahaffy gazed at his friend in wonder. He had
      only seen him spend himself on trifles, with no further object than the
      next meal or the next drink; he had believed that as he knew him so he had
      always been, lax and loose of tongue and deed, a noisy tavern hero, but
      now he saw that he was filling what must have been the measure of his
      manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I had no hand in carrying off the boy,&rdquo; said Fentress with a
      sardonic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I look to you to return him. Stir yourself, Gatewood, or by God, I'll
      hold so fierce a reckoning with you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence remained unfinished, for Fentress felt his overwrought nerves
      snap, and giving way to a sudden blind fury struck at the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are too old for rough and tumble,&rdquo; said the judge, who had displayed
      astonishing agility in avoiding the blow. &ldquo;Furthermore we were once
      gentlemen. At present I am what I am, while you are a hound and a
      blackguard! We'll settle this as becomes our breeding.&rdquo; He poured himself
      a second glass of liquor from Fentress' decanter. &ldquo;I wonder if it is
      possible to insult you,&rdquo; and he tossed glass and contents in Fentress'
      face. The colonel's thin features were convulsed. The judge watched him
      with a scornful curling of the lips. &ldquo;I am treating you better than you
      deserve,&rdquo; he taunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning at sun-up at Boggs' racetrack!&rdquo; cried Fentress. The
      judge bowed with splendid courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could please me half so well,&rdquo; he declared. He turned to the
      others. &ldquo;Gentlemen, this is a private matter. When I have met Colonel
      Fentress I shall make a public announcement of why this appeared necessary
      to me; until then I trust this matter will not be given publicity. May I
      ask your silence?&rdquo; He bowed again, and abruptly passed from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His three friends followed in his steps, leaving Fentress standing by the
      table, the ghost of a smile on his thin lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if the very place were evil, the judge hurried down the drive toward
      the road. At the gate he paused and turned on his companions, but his
      features wore a look of dignity that forbade comment or question. He held
      out his hand to Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I could command the riches of the Indies, it would tax
      my resources to meet the fractional part of my obligations to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of that!&rdquo; said Yancy, as much overwhelmed by the judge's manner as
      by his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Uncle Bob shall keep his place in my grandson's life! We'll watch him
      grow into manhood together.&rdquo; The judge was visibly affected. A smile of
      deep content parted Mr. Yancy's lips as his muscular fingers closed about
      the judge's hand with crushing force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo; cried Cavendish, delighted at this recognition of Yancy's love
      for the boy, and he gleefully smote the austere Mahaffy on the shoulder.
      But Mahaffy was dumb in the presence of the decencies, he quite lacked an
      interpreter. The judge looked back at the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The clothes he stands in, the food he eats&mdash;mine!
      Mine!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. THE BUBBLE BURSTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      At about the same hour that the judge was hurling threats and insults at
      Colonel Fentress, three men were waiting ten miles away at the head of the
      bayou which served to isolate Hicks' cabin. Now no one of these three had
      ever heard of Judge Slocum Price; the breath of his fame had never blown,
      however gently, in their direction, yet they were preparing to thrust
      opportunity upon him. To this end they were lounging about the opening in
      the woods where the horses belonging to Ware and Murrell were tied.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the dip of oars became audible in the silence and one of the
      trio stole down the path, a matter of fifty yards, to a point that
      overlooked the bayou. He was gone but a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Murrell all right!&rdquo; he said in an eager whisper. &ldquo;Him and another
      fellow&mdash;the Hicks girl is rowing them.&rdquo; He glanced from one to the
      other of his companions, who seemed to take firmer hold of themselves
      under his eye. &ldquo;It'll be all right,&rdquo; he protested lightly. &ldquo;He's as good
      as ours. Wait till I give you the word.&rdquo; And he led the way into an
      adjacent thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Ware and Murrell had landed and were coming along the path, the
      outlaw a step or two in advance of his friend. They reached the horses and
      were untying them when the thicket suddenly disgorged the three men; each
      held a cocked pistol; two of these pistols covered Murrell and the third
      was leveled at Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hues!&rdquo; cried Murrell in astonishment, for the man confronting him was the
      Clan's messenger who should have been speeding across the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toss up your hands, Murrell,&rdquo; said Hues quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the other men spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are under arrest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wanted for nigger-stealing,&rdquo; said the man. Still Murrell did not
      seem to comprehend. He looked at Hues in dull wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting to arrest you&mdash;ain't that plain?&rdquo; said Hues, with a grim
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outlaw's hands dropped at his side, limp and helpless. With some idea
      that he might attempt to draw a weapon one of the men took hold of him,
      but Murrell was nerveless to his touch; his face had gone a ghastly white
      and was streaked with the markings of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, by thunder!&rdquo; cried the man in utter amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murrell looked into Hues' face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo; and the words thickened on his tongue becoming an
      inarticulate murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all up, John,&rdquo; said Hues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Murrell, recovering himself. &ldquo;You may as well turn me loose&mdash;you
      can't arrest me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've done it,&rdquo; answered Hues, with a laugh. &ldquo;I've been on your track for
      six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about this fellow?&rdquo; asked the man, whose pistol still covered Ware.
      Hues glanced toward the planter and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to take me?&rdquo; asked Murrell quickly. Again Hues
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find that out in plenty of time, and then your friends can pass
      the word around if they like; now you'll come with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ware neither moved nor spoke as Hues and his prisoner passed back along
      the path, Hues with his hand on Murrell's shoulder, and one of his
      companions close at his heels, while the third man led off the outlaw's
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the distant clatter of hoofs was borne to Ware's ears&mdash;only
      that; the miracle of courage and daring he had half expected had not
      happened. Murrell, for all his wild boasting, was like other men, like
      himself. His bloodshot eyes slid around in their sockets. There across the
      sunlit stretch of water was Betty&mdash;the thought of her brought him to
      quick choking terrors. The whole fabric of crime by which he had been
      benefited in the past or had expected to profit in the future seemed
      toppling in upon him, but his mind clutched one important fact. Hues, if
      he knew of Betty's disappearance, did not connect Murrell with it. Ware
      sucked in comfort between his twitching lips. Stealing niggers! No one
      would believe that he, a planter, had a hand in that, and for a brief
      instant he considered signaling Bess to return. Slosson must be told of
      Murrell's arrest; but he was sick with apprehension, some trap might have
      been prepared for him, he could not know; and the impulse to act forsook
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smote his hands together in a hopeless, beaten gesture. And Murrell had
      gone weak&mdash;with his own eyes he had seen it&mdash;Murrell&mdash;whom
      he believed without fear! He felt that he had been grievously betrayed in
      his trust and a hot rage poured through him. At last he climbed into the
      saddle, and swaying like a drunken man, galloped off.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the river road he paused and scanned its dusty surface.
      Hues and his party had turned south when they issued from the wood path.
      No doubt Murrell was being taken to Memphis. Ware laughed harshly. The
      outlaw would be free before another dawn broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had halted near where Jim had turned his team the previous night after
      Betty and Hannibal had left the carriage; the marks of the wheels were as
      plainly distinguishable as the more recent trail left by the four men, and
      as he grasped the significance of that wide half circle his sense of
      injury overwhelmed him again. He hoped to live to see Murrell hanged!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so completely lost in his bitter reflections that he had been
      unaware of a mounted man who was coming toward him at a swift gallop, but
      now he heard the steady pounding of hoofs and, startled by the sound,
      looked up. A moment later the horseman drew rein at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ware!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Carrington?&rdquo; said the planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wanted at Belle Plain,&rdquo; began Carrington, and seemed to hesitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I am going there at once&mdash;now&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Ware,
      and gathered up his reins with a shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've heard, I take it?&rdquo; said Carrington slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Ware, in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;My God, Carrington, I'm heart
      sick; she has been like a daughter to me!&rdquo; he fell silent mopping his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I understand your feeling,&rdquo; said Carrington, giving him a level
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll excuse me,&rdquo; and the planter clapped spurs to his horse. Once
      he looked back over his shoulder; he saw that Carrington had not moved
      from the spot where they had met.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Belle Plain, Ware found his neighbors in possession of the place. They
      greeted him quietly and spoke in subdued tones of their sympathy. The
      planter listened with an air of such abject misery that those who had
      neither liked nor respected him, were roused to a sudden generous feeling
      where he was concerned, they could not question but that he was deeply
      affected. After all the man might have a side to his nature with which
      they had never come in contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he could he shut himself in his room. He had experienced a day of
      maddening anxiety, he had not slept at all the previous night, in mind and
      body he was worn out; and now he was plunged into the thick of this
      sensation. He must keep control of himself, for every word he said would
      be remembered. In the present there was sympathy for him, but sooner or
      later people would return to their sordid unemotional judgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought to forecast the happenings of the next few hours. Murrell's
      friends would break jail for him, that was a foregone conclusion, but the
      insurrection he had planned was at an end. Hues had dealt its death blow.
      Moreover, though the law might be impotent to deal with Murrell, he could
      not hope to escape the vengeance of the powerful class he had plotted to
      destroy; he would have to quit the country. Ware gloated in this idea of
      craven flight. Thank God, he had seen the last of him!
    </p>
    <p>
      But as always his thoughts came back to Betty. Slosson would wait at the
      Hicks' place for the man Murrell had promised him, and failing this
      messenger, for the signal fire, but there would be neither; and Slosson
      would be left to determine his own course of action. Ware felt certain
      that he would wait through the night, but as sure as the morning broke, if
      no word had reached him, he would send one of his men across the bayou,
      who must learn of Murrell's arrest, escape, flight&mdash;for in Ware's
      mind these three events were indissolubly associated. The planter's teeth
      knocked together. He was having a terrible acquaintance with fear, its
      very depths had swallowed him up; it was a black pit in which he sank from
      horror to horror. He had lost all faith in the Clan which had terrorized
      half a dozen states, which had robbed and murdered with apparent impunity,
      which had marketed its hundreds of stolen slaves. He had utterly collapsed
      at the first blow dealt the organization, but he was still seeing Murrell,
      pallid and shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      A step sounded in the hall and an instant later Hicks entered the room
      without the formality of knocking. Ware recognized his presence with a
      glance of indifference, but did not speak. Hicks slouched to his
      employer's side and handed him a note which proved to be from Fentress.
      Ware read and tossed it aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he wants to see me why don't he come here?&rdquo; he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that old fellow they call Judge Price has sprung something
      sudden on the colonel,&rdquo; said Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was out here the first thing this morning; you'd have thought he owned
      Belle Plain. There was a couple of strangers with him, and he had me in
      and fired questions at me for half an hour, then he hiked off up to The
      Oaks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murrell's been arrested,&rdquo; said Ware in a dull level voice. Hicks gave him
      a glance of unmixed astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'd risk it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risk it? Man, he almost fainted dead away&mdash;a damned coward. Hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo; asked Hicks, appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was with him when he was taken&mdash;it was Hues the man he trusted
      more than any other!&rdquo; Ware gave the overseer a ghastly grin and was
      silent, but in that silence he heard the drumming of his own heart. He
      went on. &ldquo;I tell you to save himself John Murrell will implicate the rest
      of us; we've got to get him free, and then, by hell&mdash;we ought to
      knock him in the head; he isn't fit to live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The jail ain't built that'll hold him!!&rdquo; muttered Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, he can't be held,&rdquo; agreed Ware. &ldquo;And 'he'll never be brought
      to trial; no lawyer will dare appear against him, no jury will dare find
      him guilty; but there's Hues, what about him?&rdquo; He paused. The two men
      looked at each other for a long moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did they carry the captain?&rdquo; inquired Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks like the Clan was in a hell-fired hole&mdash;but shucks! What
      will be easier than to fix Hues?&mdash;and while they're fixing folks
      they'd better not overlook that old fellow Price. He's got some notion
      about Fentress and the boy.&rdquo; Mr. Hicks did not consider it necessary to
      explain that he was himself largely responsible for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; demanded Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He as good as said so.&rdquo; Hicks looked uneasily at the planter. He knew
      himself to be compromised. The stranger named Cavendish had forced an
      admission from him that Murrell would not condone if it came to his
      knowledge. He had also acquired a very proper and wholesome fear of Judge
      Slocum Price. He stepped close to Ware's side. &ldquo;What'll come of the girl,
      Tom? Can you figure that out?&rdquo; he questioned, sinking his voice almost to
      a whisper. But Ware was incapable of speech, again his terrors completely
      overwhelmed him. &ldquo;I reckon you'll have to find another overseer. I'm going
      to strike out for Texas,&rdquo; said Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ware's eyes met his for an instant. He had thought of flight, too, was
      still thinking of it, but greed was as much a part of his nature as fear;
      Belle Plain was a prize not to be lightly cast aside, and it was almost
      his. He lurched across the room to the window. If he were going to act,
      the sooner he did so the better, and gain a respite from his fears. The
      road down the coast slid away before his heavy eyes, he marked each turn;
      then a palsy of fear shook him, his heart beat against his ribs, and he
      stood gnawing his lips while he gazed up at the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you get what I say, Tom? I am going to quit these parts,&rdquo; said Hicks.
      Ware turned slowly from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Hicks. You mean you want me to settle with you, is that it?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm going to leave while I can, maybe I can't later on,&rdquo; said Hicks
      stolidly. He added: &ldquo;I am going to start down the coast as soon as it
      turns dark, and before it's day again I'll have put the good miles between
      me and these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going down the coast?&rdquo; and Ware was again conscious of the
      quickened beating of his heart. Hicks nodded. &ldquo;See you don't meet up with
      John Murrell,&rdquo; said Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take that chance. It seems a heap better to me than staying here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ware looked from the window. The shadows were lengthening across the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better start now, Hicks,&rdquo; he advised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll wait until it turns dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll need a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to help myself to one. This ain't no time to stand on
      ceremony,&rdquo; said Hicks shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slosson shouldn't be left in the lurch like this&mdash;or your brother's
      folks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll have to figure it out for themselves same as me,&rdquo; rejoined Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stop there as you go by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hicks; &ldquo;I never did believe in this damn foolishness about the
      girl, and I won't go near George's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ask you to go there, you can give them the signal from the head
      of the bayou. All I want is for you to stop and light a fire on the shore.
      They'll know what that means. I'll give you a horse and fifty dollars for
      the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hicks' eyes sparkled, but he only said
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it twice that and maybe we can deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Racked and tortured, Ware hesitated; but the sun was slipping into the
      west, his windows blazed with the hot light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swear you'll do your part?&rdquo; he said thickly. He took his purse from
      his pocket and counted out the amount due Hicks. He named the total, and
      paused irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you want the fire lighted?&rdquo; asked Hicks. He was familiar with his
      employer's vacillating moods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Ware, his lips quivering; and slowly, with shaking
      fingers, he added to the pile of bills in Hicks' hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take care of yourself,&rdquo; said Hicks, when the count was complete. He
      thrust the roll of bills into his pocket and moved to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone again, the planter collapsed into his chair, breathing heavily, but
      his terrors swept over him and left him with a savage sense of triumph.
      This passed, he sprang up, intending to recall Hicks and unmake his
      bargain. What had he been thinking of&mdash;safety lay only in flight!
      Before he reached the door his greed was in the ascendant. He dropped down
      on the edge of his bed, his eyes fixed on the window. The sun sank lower.
      From where he sat he saw it through the upper half of the sash, blood-red
      and livid in a mist of fleecy clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the tops of the old oaks now, which sent their shadows into his
      room. Again maddened by his terrors he started up and backed toward the
      door; but again his greed, the one dominating influence in his life,
      vanquished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched the sun sink. He watched the red splendor fade over the river;
      he saw the first stars appear. He told himself that Hicks would soon be
      gone&mdash;if the fire was not to be lighted he must act at once! He stole
      to the window. It was dusk now, yet he could distinguish the distant
      wooded boundaries of the great fields framed by the darkening sky. Then in
      the silence he heard the thud of hoofs.

      CHAPTER XXXI. THE KEEL BOAT
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PRICE,&rdquo; began Mahaffy. They were back in Raleigh in the room the judge
      called his office, and this was Mahaffy's first opportunity to ease his
      mind on the subject of the duel, as they had only just parted from Yancy
      and Cavendish, who had stopped at one of the stores to make certain
      purchases for the raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word, Solomon&mdash;it had to come. I am going to kill him. I shall
      feel better then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if he kills you?&rdquo; demanded Mahaffy harshly. The judge shrugged his
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is as it may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten your grandson?&rdquo; Mahaffy's voice was still harsh and
      rasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regard my meeting with Fentress as nothing less than a sacred duty to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know no more than we did this morning,&rdquo; said Mahaffy. &ldquo;You are mixing
      up all sorts of side issues with what should be your real purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, Solomon&mdash;not at all! I look upon my grandson's speedy
      recovery as an assured fact. Fentress dare not hold him. He knows he is
      run to earth at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Solomon&mdash;no, my friend, we will not speak of it again. You will
      go back to Belle Plain with Yancy and Cavendish; you must represent me
      there. We have as good as found Hannibal, but we must be active in Miss
      Malroy's behalf. For us that has an important bearing on the future, and
      since I can not, you must be at Belle Plain when Carrington arrives with
      his pack of dogs. Give him the advantage of your sound and mature
      judgment, Solomon; don't let any false modesty keep you in the
      background.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's going to second you?&rdquo; snapped Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge was the picture of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be quite informal, the code is scarcely applicable; I merely
      intend to remove him because he is not fit to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At sun-up!&rdquo; muttered Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to start one day right even if I never live to begin another,&rdquo;
       said the judge, a sudden fierce light flashing from his eyes. &ldquo;I feel that
      this is the turning point in my career, Solomon!&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The
      beginning of great things! But I shall take no chances with the future, I
      shall prepare for every possible contingency. I am going to make you and
      Yancy my grandson's guardians. There's a hundred thousand acres of land
      hereabout that must come to him. I shall outline in writing the legal
      steps to be taken to substantiate his claims. Also he will inherit largely
      from me at my death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something very like laughter escaped from Mahaffy's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go, Solomon, with your inopportune mirth! What in God's name
      have I if I haven't hope? Take that from me and what would I be? Why, the
      very fate I have been fighting off with tooth and nail would overwhelm me.
      I'd sink into unimportance&mdash;my unparalleled misfortunes would degrade
      me to a level with the commonest! No, sir, I've never been without hope,
      and though I've fallen I've always got up. What Fentress has is based on
      money he stole from me. By God, the days of his profit-taking are at an
      end! I am going to strip him. And even if I don't live to enjoy what's
      mine, my grandson shall! He shall wear velvet and a lace collar and ride
      his pony yet, by God, as a gentleman's grandson should!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds well, Price, but where's the money coming from to push a
      lawsuit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge waved this aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The means will be found, Solomon. Our horizon is lifting&mdash;I can see
      it lift! Don't drag me back from the portal of hope! We'll drink the stuff
      that comes across the water; I'll warm the cockles of your heart with
      imported brandy. I carry twenty years' hunger and thirst under my wes-coat
      and I'll feed and drink like a gentleman yet!&rdquo; The judge smacked his lips
      in an ecstasy of enjoyment, and dropping down before the table which
      served him as a desk, seized a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's good enough to think about, Price,&rdquo; admitted Mahaffy grudgingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's better to do; and if anything happens to me the papers I am going to
      leave will tell you how it's to be done. Man, there's a million of money
      in sight, and we've got to get it and spend it and enjoy it! None of your
      swinish thrift for me, but life on a big scale&mdash;company, and
      feasting, and refined surroundings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are going to meet Fentress in the morning?&rdquo; asked Mahaffy. &ldquo;I
      suppose there's no way of avoiding that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avoiding it?&rdquo; almost shouted the judge. &ldquo;For what have I been living? I
      shall meet him, let the consequences be what they may. To-night when I
      have reduced certain facts to writing I shall join you at Belle Plain. The
      strange and melancholy history of my life I shall place in your hands for
      safe keeping. In the morning I can be driven back to Boggs'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will go there without a second?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If necessary; yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Price, you are hardly fitted to be at large! Why, you act as
      if you were tired of life. There's Yancy&mdash;there's Cavendish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge gave him an indulgent but superior smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two very worthy men, but I go to Boggs' attended by a gentleman or I go
      there alone. I am aware of your prejudices, Solomon; otherwise I might ask
      this favor of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mahaffy snorted loudly and turned to the door, for Yancy and Cavendish
      were now approaching the house, the latter with a meal sack slung over his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Solomon, take one of my pistols,&rdquo; urged the judge hastily. &ldquo;You may
      need it at Belle Plain. Goodby, and God bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just where he had parted from Ware, Carrington sat his horse, his brows
      knit and his eyes turned in the direction of the path. He was on his way
      to a plantation below Girard, the owner of which had recently imported a
      pack of bloodhounds; but this unexpected encounter with Ware had affected
      him strangely. He still heard Tom's stammering speech, he was still seeing
      his ghastly face, and he had come upon him with startling suddenness. He
      had chanced to look back over his shoulder and when he faced about there
      had been the planter within a hundred yards of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Carrington's glance ceased to follow the windings of the path.
      He stared down at the gray dust and saw the trail left by Hues and his
      party. For a moment he hesitated; if the dogs were to be used with any
      hope of success he had no time to spare, and this was the merest
      suspicion, illogical conjecture, based on nothing beyond his distrust of
      Ware. In the end he sprang from the saddle and leading his horse into the
      woods, tied it to a sapling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hurried investigation told him that five men had ridden in and out of
      that path. Of the five, all coming from the south, four had turned south
      again, but the fifth man&mdash;Ware, in other words&mdash;had gone north.
      He weighed the possible significance of these facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only wasting time!&rdquo; he confessed reluctantly, and was on the point
      of turning away, when, on the very edge of the road and just where the
      dust yielded to the hard clay of the path, his glance lighted on the print
      of a small and daintily shod foot. The throbbing of his heart quickened
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty!&rdquo; The word leaped from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      That small foot had left but the one impress. There were other signs,
      however, that claimed his attention; namely, the bootprints of Slosson and
      his men; and he made the inevitable discovery that these tracks were all
      confined to the one spot. They began suddenly and as suddenly ceased, yet
      there was no mystery about these; he had the marks of the wheels to help
      him to a sure conclusion. A carriage had turned just here, several men had
      alighted, they had with them a child or a woman. Either they had reentered
      the carriage and driven back as they had come, or they had gone toward the
      river. He felt the soul within him turn sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole along the path; the terror of the river was ever in his thoughts,
      and the specter of his fear seemed to flit before him and lure him on.
      Presently he caught his first glimpse of the bayou and his legs shook
      under him; but the path wound deeper still into what appeared to be an
      untouched solitude, wound on between the crowding tree forms, a little
      back from the shore, with an intervening tangle of vines and bushes. He
      scanned this closely as he hurried forward, scarcely conscious that he was
      searching for some trampled space at the water's edge; but the verdant
      wall preserved its unbroken continuity, and twenty minutes later he came
      within sight of the Hicks' clearing and the keel boat, where it rested
      against the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little farther on he found the spot where Slosson had launched the skiff
      the night before. The keel of his boat had cut deep into the slippery
      clay; more than this, the impress of the small shoe was repeated here, and
      just beside it was the print of a child's bare foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He no longer doubted that Betty and Hannibal had been taken across the
      bayou to the cabin, and he ran back up the path the distance of a mile and
      plunged into the woods on his right, his purpose being to pass around the
      head of the expanse of sluggish water to a point from which he could later
      approach the cabin. But the cabin proved to be better defended than he had
      foreseen; and as he advanced, the difficulties of the task he had set
      himself became almost insurmountable; yet sustained as he was by his
      imperative need, he tore his way through the labyrinth of trailing vines,
      or floundered across acre-wide patches of green slime and black mud, which
      at each step threatened to engulf him in their treacherous depths, until
      at the end of an hour he gained the southern side of the clearing and a
      firmer footing within the shelter of the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he paused and took stock of his surroundings. The two or three
      buildings Mr. Hicks had erected stood midway of the clearing and were very
      modest improvements adapted to their owner's somewhat flippant pursuit of
      agriculture. While Carrington was still staring about him, the cabin door
      swung open and a woman stepped forth. It was the girl Bess. She went to a
      corner of the building and called loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe! Oh, Joe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington glanced in the direction of the keel boat and an instant later
      saw Slosson clamber over its side. The tavern-keeper crossed to the cabin,
      where he was met by Bess, who placed in his hands what seemed to be a
      wooden bowl. With this he slouched off to one of the outbuildings, which
      he entered. Ten or fifteen minutes slipped by, then he came from the shed
      and after securing the door, returned to the cabin. He was again met by
      Bess, who relieved him of the bowl; they exchanged a few words and Slosson
      walked away and afterward disappeared over the side of the keel boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much was clear to the Kentuckian: food had been taken to some one in
      the shed&mdash;to Betty and the boy!&mdash;more likely to George.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited now for the night to come, and to him the sun seemed fixed in
      the heavens. At Belle Plain Tom Ware was watching it with a shuddering
      sense of the swiftness of its flight. But at last the tops of the tall
      trees obscured it; it sank quickly then and blazed a ball of fire beyond
      the Arkansas coast, while its dying glory spread aslant the heavens,
      turning the flanks of the gray clouds to violet and purple and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first approach of darkness Carrington made his way to the shed.
      Hidden in the shadow he paused to listen, and fancied he heard difficult
      breathing from within. The door creaked hideously on its wooden hinges
      when he pushed it open, but as it swung back the last remnant of the day's
      light showed him some dark object lying prone on the dirt floor. He
      reached down and his hand rested on a man's booted foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George&mdash;&rdquo; Carrington spoke softly, but the man on the floor gave no
      sign that he heard, and Carrington's questioning touch stealing higher he
      found that George&mdash;if it were George&mdash;was lying on his side with
      his arms and legs securely bound. Thinking he slept, the Kentuckian shook
      him gently to arouse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George?&rdquo; he repeated, still bending above him. This time an inarticulate
      murmur answered him. At the same instant the woolly head of the negro came
      under his fingers and he discovered the reason of his silence. He was as
      securely gagged as he was bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, George&mdash;it's Carrington&mdash;I am going to take off this
      gag, but don't speak above a whisper&mdash;they may hear us!&rdquo; And he cut
      the cords that held the gag in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How yo' get here, Mas'r Ca'ington?&rdquo; asked the negro guardedly, as the gag
      fell away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Around the head of the bayou.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd!&rdquo; exclaimed George, in a tone of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Miss Betty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's in the cabin yonder&mdash;fo' the love of God, cut these here other
      ropes with yo' knife, Mas'r Ca'ington&mdash;I'm perishin' with 'em!&rdquo;
       Carrington did as he asked, and groaning, George sat erect. &ldquo;I'm like I
      was gone to sleep all over,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll feel better in a moment. Tell me about Miss Malroy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They done fetched us here last night. I was drivin' Missy into Raleigh&mdash;her
      and young Mas'r Hazard&mdash;when fo' men stop us in the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were they, do you know?&rdquo; asked Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd&mdash;what's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington, knife in hand swung about on his heel. A lantern's light
      flashed suddenly in his face and Bess Hicks, with a low startled cry
      breaking from her lips, paused in the doorway. Springing forward,
      Carrington seized her by the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he grimly warned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doin' here?&rdquo; demanded the girl, as she endeavored to shake
      off his hand, but Carrington drew her into the shed, and closing the door,
      set his back against it. There was a brief silence during which Bess
      regarded the Kentuckian with a kind of stolid fearlessness. She was the
      first to speak. &ldquo;I reckon you-all have come after Miss Malroy,&rdquo; she
      observed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you reckon right,&rdquo; answered Carrington. The girl studied him from
      beneath her level brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you-all think you can take her away from here,&rdquo; she speculated. &ldquo;I
      ain't afraid of yo' knife&mdash;you-all might use it fast enough on a man,
      but not on me. I'll help you,&rdquo; she added. Carrington gave her an
      incredulous glance. &ldquo;You don't believe me? What's to hinder my calling for
      help? That would fetch our men up from the keel boat. No&mdash;yo'-all's
      knife wouldn't stop me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be too sure of that,&rdquo; said Carrington sternly. The girl met the
      menace of his words with soft, fullthroated laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yo' hand's shakin' now, Mr. Carrington!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I seen you once at Boggs'.&rdquo; She made an impatient movement. &ldquo;You
      can't do nothing against them fo' men unless I help you. Miss Malroy's to
      go down river to-night; they're only waiting fo' a pilot&mdash;you-all's
      got to act quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want Miss Malroy to escape?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's mood changed abruptly. She scowled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that's a private matter. Ain't it enough fo' you-all to know
      that I do? I'm showing how it can be done. Them four men on the keel boat
      are strangers in these parts, they're waiting fo' a pilot, but they don't
      know who he'll be. I've heard you-all was a riverman; what's to hinder yo'
      taking the pilot's place? Looks like yo' was willing to risk yo' life fo'
      Miss Malroy or you wouldn't be here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm ready,&rdquo; said Carrington, his hand on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you ain't&mdash;jest yet,&rdquo; interposed the girl hastily. &ldquo;Listen to me
      first. They's a dugout tied up 'bout a hundred yards above the keel boat;
      you must get that to cross in to the other side of the bayou, then when
      yo're ready to come back yo're to whistle three times&mdash;it's the
      signal we're expecting&mdash;and I'll row across fo' you in one of the
      skiffs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see Miss Malroy in the meantime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I want to, they's nothin' to hinder me,&rdquo; responded Bess sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her then&mdash;&rdquo; began Carrington, but Bess interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what yo' want. She ain't to cry out or nothin' when she sees
      you-all. I got sense enough fo' that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington looked at her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This may be a serious business for your people,&rdquo; he said significantly,
      and watched her narrowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you-all may get killed. I reckin if yo' want to do a thing bad enough
      you don't mind much what comes after,&rdquo; she answered with a hard little
      laugh, as she went from the shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Carrington to the negro, when he had seen the cabin door
      close on Bess and her lantern; and they stole across the clearing.
      Reaching the bayou side they began a noiseless search for the dugout,
      which they quickly found, and Carrington turned to George. &ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mas'r.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go down into the water and drag the canoe farther along the shore&mdash;and
      for God's sake, no sound!&rdquo; he cautioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      They placed a second hundred yards between themselves and the keel boat in
      this manner, then he had George bring the dug-out to the bank, and they
      embarked. Keeping within the shadow of the trees that fringed the shore,
      Carrington paddled silently about the head of the bayou.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George,&rdquo; he at length said, bending toward the negro; &ldquo;my horse is tied
      in the woods on the right-hand side of the road just above where you were
      taken from the carriage last night&mdash;you can be at Belle Plain inside
      of an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mas'r Ca'ington, those folks yonder is kin to Boss Hicks. If
      he get his hand on me first don't you reckon he'll stop my mouth? I been
      here heaps of times fotchin' letters fo' Mas'r Tom,&rdquo; added George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who were the letters for?&rdquo; asked the Kentuckian, greatly surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They was fo' that Captain Murrell; seems like him and Mas'r Tom was mixed
      up in a sight of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was this&mdash;recently?&rdquo; inquired Carrington. He was turning this
      astonishing statement of the slave over in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, Mas'r; seems like they ain't so thick here recently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you'd better keep away from the big house yet a while,&rdquo; said
      Carrington. &ldquo;Instead of going there, stop at the Belle Plain landing.
      You'll find a raft tied up to the shore, it belongs to a man named
      Cavendish. Tell him what you know. That I've found Miss Malroy and the
      boy, tell him to cast off and drift down here. I'll run the keel boat
      aground the first chance I get, so tell him to keep a sharp lookout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later they had separated, George to hurry away in search of
      the horse, and Carrington to pass back along the shore until he gained a
      point opposite the clearing. He whistled shrilly three times, and after an
      interval of waiting heard the splash of oars and presently saw a skiff
      steal out of the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; It was Bess who asked the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carrington,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky you ain't met the other man!&rdquo; she said as she swept her skiff
      alongside the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky for him, you mean. I'll take the oars,&rdquo; added Carrington as he
      entered the skiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the clearing lifted out of the darkness, then the keel boat became
      distinguishable; and Carrington checked the skiff by a backward stroke of
      the oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no immediate answer to his hail, and he called again as he sent
      the skiff forward. He felt that he was risking all now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked a surly voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want Slosson!&rdquo; quickly prompted the girl in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see Slosson!&rdquo; said Carrington glibly and with confidence, and
      once more he checked the skiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murrell sent you,&rdquo; prompted the girl again, in a hurried whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murrell&mdash;&rdquo; And in his astonishment Carrington spoke aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murrell?&rdquo; cried the voice sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;sent me!&rdquo; said Carrington quickly, as though completing an
      unfinished sentence. The girl laughed nervously under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Row closter!&rdquo; came the sullen command, and the Kentuckian did as he was
      bidden. Four men stood in the bow of the keel boat, a lantern was raised
      aloft and by its light they looked him over. There was a moment's silence
      broken by Carrington, who asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one of you is Slosson?&rdquo; And he sprang lightly aboard the keel boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Slosson,&rdquo; answered the man with the lantern. The previous night Mr.
      Slosson had been somewhat under the enlivening and elevating influence of
      corn whisky, but now he was his own cheerless self, and rather jaded by
      the passing of the hours which he had sacrificed to an irksome
      responsibility. &ldquo;What word do you fetch from the Captain, brother?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Malroy is to be taken down river,&rdquo; responded Carrington. Slosson
      swore with surpassing fluency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, we're five able-bodied men risking our necks to oblige him! You can
      get married a damn sight easier than this if you go about it right&mdash;I've
      done it lots of times.&rdquo; Not understanding the significance of Slosson's
      allusion to his own matrimonial career, Carrington held his peace. The
      tavern-beeper swore again with unimpaired vigor. &ldquo;You'll find mighty few
      men with more experience than me,&rdquo; he asserted, shaking his head. &ldquo;But if
      you say the word&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm all for getting shut of this!&rdquo; answered Carrington promptly, with a
      sweep of his arm. &ldquo;I call these pretty close quarters!&rdquo; Still shaking his
      head and muttering, the tavernkeeper sprang ashore and mounted the bank,
      where his slouching figure quickly lost itself in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrington took up his station on the flat roof of the cabin which filled
      the stern of the boat. He was remembering that day in the sandy Barony
      road&mdash;and during all the weeks and months that had intervened,
      Murrell, working in secret, had moved steadily toward the fulfilment of
      his desires! Unquestionably he had been back of the attack on Norton, had
      inspired his subsequent murder, and the man's sinister and mysterious
      power had never been suspected. Carrington knew that the horse-thieves and
      slave stealers were supposed to maintain a loosely knit association; he
      wondered if Murrell were not the moving spirit in some such organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'd only pushed my quarrel with him!&rdquo; he thought bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard Slosson's shuffling step in the distance, a word or two when he
      spoke gruffly to some one, and a moment later he saw Betty and the boy,
      their forms darkly silhouetted against the lighter sky as they moved along
      the top of the bank. Slosson, without any superfluous gallantry, helped
      his captives down the slope and aboard the keel boat, where he locked them
      in the cabin, the door of which fastened with a hasp and wooden peg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're boss now, pardner!&rdquo; he said, joining Carrington at the steering
      oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll cast off then,&rdquo; answered Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far nothing had occurred to mar his plans. If they could but quit the
      bayou before the arrival of the man whose place he had taken, the rest
      would be if not easy of accomplishment, at least within the realm of the
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you're a river-man?&rdquo; observed Slosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The line had been cast off, and the crew with their setting poles were
      forcing the boat away from the bank. All was quietly done; except for an
      occasional order from Carrington no word was spoken, and soon the unwieldy
      craft glided into the sluggish current and gathered way. Mr. Slosson, who
      clearly regarded his relation to the adventure as being of an official
      character, continued to stand at Carrington's elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have we, between here and the river?&rdquo; inquired the latter. It was
      best, he felt, not to give Slosson an opportunity to ask questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It narrows considerably, pardner, but it's a straight course,&rdquo; said
      Slosson. &ldquo;Black in yonder, ain't it?&rdquo; he added, nodding ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shores drew rapidly together; they were leaving the lakelike expanse
      behind. In the silence, above the rustling of the trees, Carrington heard
      the first fret of 'the river against its bank. Slosson yawned
      prodigiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you ain't needing me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better go up in the bow and get some sleep,&rdquo; advised Carrington, and
      Slosson, nothing loath, clambered down from the roof of the cabin and
      stumbled forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceaseless murmur of the rushing waters grew in the stillness as the
      keel boat drew nearer the hurrying yellow flood, and the beat of the
      Kentuckian's pulse quickened. Would he find the raft there? He glanced
      back over the way they had come. The dark ranks of the forest walled off
      the clearing, but across the water a dim point of light was visible. He
      fixed its position as somewhere near the head of the bayou. Apparently it
      was a lantern, but as he looked a ruddy glow crept up against the
      sky-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the bow Bunker had been observing this singular phenomenon. Suddenly
      he bent and roused Slosson, who had fallen asleep. The tavern-keeper
      sprang to his feet and Bunker pointed without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebby you can tell me what that light back yonder means?&rdquo; cried Slosson,
      addressing himself to Carrington; as he spoke he snatched up his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I'm trying to make out,&rdquo; answered Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; cried Slosson, and tossed his gun to his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      What seemed to be a breath of wind lifted a stray lock of Carrington's
      hair, but his pistol answered Slosson in the same second. He fired at the
      huddle of men in the bow of the boat and one of them pitched forward with
      his arms outspread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep back, you!&rdquo; he said, and dropped off the cabin roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      His promptness had bred a momentary panic, then Slosson's bull-like voice
      began to roar commands; but in that brief instant of surprise and shock
      Carrington had found and withdrawn the wooden peg that fastened the cabin
      door. He had scarcely done this when Slosson came tramping aft supported
      by the three men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling to Betty and Hannibal to escape in the skiff which was towing
      astern the Kentuckian rushed toward the bow. At his back he heard the door
      creak on its hinges as it was pushed open by Betty and the boy, and again
      he called to them to escape by the skiff. The fret of the current had
      grown steadily and from beneath the wide-flung branches of the trees which
      here met above his head, Carrington caught sight of the starspecked arch
      of the heavens beyond. They were issuing from the bayou. He felt the river
      snatch at the keel boat, the buffeting of some swift eddy, and saw the
      blunt bow swing off to the south as they were plunged into the black shore
      shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what he did not see was a big muscular hand which had thrust itself
      out of the impenetrable gloom and clutched the side of the keel boat.
      Coincident with this there arose a perfect babel of voices, high-pitched
      and shrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho&mdash;I bet it's him! Sho'&mdash;it's Uncle Bob's nevvy! Sho', you
      can hear 'em! Sho', they're shootin' guns! Sho'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington cast a hurried glance in the direction of these sounds. There
      between the boat and the shore the dim outline of a raft was taking shape.
      It was now canopied by a wealth of pale gray smoke that faded from before
      his eyes as the darkness lifted. Turning, he saw Slosson and his men
      clearly. Surprise and consternation was depicted on each face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light increased. From the flat stone hearth of the raft ascended a
      tall column of flame which rendered visible six pygmy figures, tow-headed
      and wonderfully vocal, who were toiling like mad at the huge sweeps. The
      light showed more than this. It showed a lady of plump and pleasing
      presence smoking a cobpipe while she fed the fire from a tick stuffed with
      straw. It showed two bark shanties, a line between them decorated with the
      never-ending Cavendish wash. It showed a rooster perched on the ridge-pole
      of one of these shanties in the very act of crowing lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal, who had climbed to the roof of the cabin, shrieked for help, and
      Betty added her voice to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Nevvy!&rdquo; came the cheerful reply, as Yancy threw himself over
      the side of the boat and grappled with Slosson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob! Uncle Bob!&rdquo; cried Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slosson uttered a cry of terror. He had a simple but sincere faith in the
      supernatural, and even with the Scratch Hiller's big hands gripping his
      throat, he could not rid himself of the belief that this was the ghost of
      a murdered man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll take a dog's licking from me, neighbor?&rdquo; said Yancy grimly. &ldquo;I
      been saving it fo' you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr. Cavendish, whose proud spirit never greatly inclined him to
      the practice of peace, had prepared for battle; Springing aloft he knocked
      his heels together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoop! I'm a man as can slide down a thorny locust and never get
      scratched!&rdquo; he shouted. This was equivalent to setting his triggers; then
      he launched himself nimbly and with enthusiasm into the thick of the
      fight. It was Mr. Bunker's unfortunate privilege to sustain the onslaught
      of the Earl of Lambeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light from the Cavendish hearth continued to brighten the scene, for
      Polly was recklessly sacrificing her best straw tick. Indeed her behavior
      was in every way worthy of the noble alliance she had formed. Her cob-pipe
      was not suffered to go out and with Connie's help she kept the six small
      Cavendishes from risking life and limb in the keel boat, toward which they
      were powerfully drawn. Despite these activities she found time to call to
      Betty and Hannibal on the cabin roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump down here; that ain't no fittin' place for you-all to stop in with
      them gentlemen fightin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An instant later Betty and Hannibal stood on the raft with the little
      Cavendishes flocking about them. Mr. Yancy's quest of his nevvy had taken
      an enduring hold on their imagination. For weeks it had constituted their
      one vital topic, and the fight became merely a satisfying background for
      this interesting restoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho', they'd got him! Sho'&mdash;he wa'n't no bigger than Richard! Sho'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Betty, with a fearful glance toward the keel boat. &ldquo;Can't you
      stop them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fo'?&rdquo; asked Polly, opening her black eyes very wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless yo' tender heart!-you don't need to worry none, we got them strange
      gentlemen licked like they was a passel of children! Connie, you-all mind
      that fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She accurately judged the outcome of the fight. The boat was little better
      than a shambles with the havoc that had been wrought there when Yancy and
      Carrington dropped over its side to the raft. Cavendish followed them,
      whooping his triumph as he came.

      CHAPTER XXXII. THE RAFT AGAIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Yancy and Cavendish threw themselves on the sweeps and worked the raft
      clear of the keel boat, then the turbulent current seized the smaller
      craft and whirled it away into the night; as its black bulk receded from
      before his eyes the Earl of Lambeth spoke with the voice of authority and
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a good fight and them fellows done well, but not near well
      enough.&rdquo; A conclusion that could not be gainsaid. He added, &ldquo;No one ain't
      hurt but them that had ought to have got hurt. Mr. Yancy's all right, and
      so's Mr. Carrington&mdash;who's mighty welcome here.&rdquo; The earl's shock of
      red hair was bristling like the mane of some angry animal and his eyes
      still flashed with the light of battle, but he managed to summon up an
      expression of winning friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Carrington's kin to me, Polly,&rdquo; explained Yancy to Mrs. Cavendish.
      His voice was far from steady, for Hannibal had been gathered into his
      arms and had all but wrecked the stoic calm with which the Scratch Hiller
      was seeking to guard his emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly smiled and dimpled at the Kentuckian. Trained to a romantic point of
      view she had a frank liking for handsome stalwart men. Cavendish was
      neither, but none knew better than Polly that where he was most lacking in
      appearance he was richest in substance. He carried scars honorably earned
      in those differences he had been prone to cultivate with less generous
      natures; for his scheme of life did not embrace the millennium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, you got here when you did!&rdquo; said Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We was some pushed fo' time, but we done it,&rdquo; responded the earl
      modestly. He added, &ldquo;What now?&mdash;do we make a landing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;unless it interferes with your plans not to. I 'want to get
      around the next bend before we tie up. Later we'll all go back. Can I
      count on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shorely can. I consider this here as sociable a neighborhood as I
      ever struck. It pleases me well. Folks are up and doing hereabout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington looked eagerly around in search of Betty. She was sitting on an
      upturned tub, a pathetic enough figure as she drooped against the wall of
      one of the shanties with all her courage quite gone from her. He made his
      way quickly to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La!&rdquo; whispered Polly in Chills and Fever's ear. &ldquo;If that pore young thing
      yonder keeps a widow it won't be because of any encouragement she gets
      from Mr. Carrington. If I ever seen marriage in a man's eye I seen it in
      his this minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bruce!&rdquo; cried Betty, starting up as Carrington approached. &ldquo;Oh, Bruce, I
      am so glad you have come&mdash;you are not hurt?&rdquo; She accepted his
      presence without question. She had needed him and he had not failed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are none of us hurt, Betty,&rdquo; he said gently, as he took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that the suffering she had undergone during the preceding
      twenty-four hours had left its record on her tired face and in her heavy
      eyes. She retained a shuddering consciousness of the unchecked savagery of
      those last moments on the keel boat; she was still hearing the oaths of
      the men as they struggled together, the sound of blows, and the dreadful
      silences that had followed them. She turned from him, and there came the
      relief of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Betty, the danger is over now and you were so brave while it
      lasted. I can't bear to have you cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wild with fear&mdash;all that time on the boat, Bruce&mdash;&rdquo; she
      faltered between her sobs. &ldquo;I didn't know but they would find you out. I
      could only wait and hope&mdash;and pray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in no danger, dear. Didn't the girl tell you I was to take the
      place of a man Slosson was expecting? He never doubted that I was that man
      until a light&mdash;a signal it must have been&mdash;on the shore at the
      head of the bayou betrayed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going now, Bruce? Not the way they went&mdash;&rdquo; and Betty
      glanced out into the black void where the keel boat had merged into the
      gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no&mdash;but we can't get the raft back up-stream against the
      current, so the best thing is to land at the Bates' plantation below here;
      then as soon as you are able we can return to Belle Plain,&rdquo; said
      Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an interval broken only by the occasional sweep of the great
      steering oar as Cavendish coaxed the raft out toward the channel. The
      thought of Charley Norton's murder rested on Carrington like a pall.
      Scarcely a week had elapsed since he quitted Thicket Point and in that
      week the hand of death had dealt with them impartially, and to what end?
      Then the miles he had traversed in his hopeless journey up-river
      translated themselves into a division of time as well as space. They were
      just so much further removed from the past with its blight of tragic
      terror. He turned and glanced at Betty. He saw that her eyes held their
      steady look of wistful pity that was for the dead man; yet in spite of
      this, and in spite of the bounds beyond which he would not let his
      imagination carry him, the future enriched with sudden promise unfolded
      itself. The deep sense of recovered hope stirred within him. He knew there
      must come a day when he would dare to speak of his love, and she would
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's best we should land at Bates' place&mdash;we can get teams there,&rdquo;
       he went on to explain. &ldquo;And, Betty, wherever we go we'll go together,
      dear. Cavendish doesn't look as if he had any very urgent business of his
      own, and I reckon the same is true of Yancy, so I am going to keep them
      with us. There are some points to be cleared up when we reach Belle Plain&mdash;some
      folks who'll have a lot to explain or else quit this part of the state!
      And I intend to see that you are not left alone until&mdash;until I have
      the right to take care of you for good and all&mdash;that's what you want
      me to do one of these days, isn't it, darling?&rdquo; and his eyes, glowing and
      infinitely tender, dwelt on her upturned face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Betty shrank from him in involuntary agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not now, Bruce&mdash;not now&mdash;we mustn't speak of that&mdash;it's
      wrong&mdash;it's wicked&mdash;you mustn't make me forget him!&rdquo; she cried
      brokenly, in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Betty, I'll not speak of it again,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Bruce, and some time&mdash;Oh, don't make me say it,&rdquo; she gasped,
      &ldquo;or I shall hate myself!&rdquo; for in his presence she was feeling the horror
      of her past experience grow strangely remote, only the dull ache of her
      memories remained, and to these she clung. They were silent for a moment,
      then Carrington said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After I'm sure you'll be safe here perhaps I'll go south into the Choctaw
      Purchase. I've been thinking of that recently; but I'll find my way back
      here&mdash;don't misunderstand me&mdash;I'll not come too soon for even
      you, Betty. I loved Norton. He was one of my best friends, too,&rdquo; he
      continued gently. &ldquo;But you know&mdash;and I know&mdash;dear, the day will
      come when no matter where you are I shall find you again&mdash;find you
      and not lose you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty made no answer in words, but a soft and eloquent little hand was
      slipped into his and allowed to rest there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a light wind stirred the dead dense atmosphere, the mist lifted
      and enveloped the shore, showing them the river between piled-up masses of
      vapor. Apparently it ran for their raft alone. It was just twenty-four
      hours since Carrington had looked upon such another night but this was a
      different world the gray fog was unmasking&mdash;a world of hopes, and
      dreams, and rich content. Then the thought of Norton&mdash;poor Norton who
      had had his world, too, of hopes and dreams and rich content&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The calm of a highly domestic existence had resumed its interrupted sway
      on the raft. Mr. Cavendish, associated in Betty's memory with certain
      earsplitting manifestations of ferocious rage, became in the bosom of his
      family low-voiced and genial and hopelessly impotent to deal with his five
      small sons; while Yancy was again the Bob Yancy of Scratch Hill, violence
      of any sort apparently had no place in his nature. He was deeply absorbed
      in Hannibal's account of those vicissitudes which had befallen him during
      their separation. They were now seated before a cheerful fire that blazed
      on the hearth, the boy very close to Yancy with one hand clasped in the
      Scratch Hiller's, while about them were ranged the six small Cavendishes
      sedately sharing in the reunion of uncle and nevvy, toward which they felt
      they had honorably labored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you wa'n't dead, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; said Hannibal with a deep breath,
      viewing Yancy unmistakably in the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never once. I been floating peacefully along with these here titled
      friends of mine; but I was some anxious about you, son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Slosson, Uncle Bob&mdash;did you smack him like you smacked Dave
      Blount that day when he tried to steal me?&rdquo; asked Hannibal, whose childish
      sense of justice demanded reparation for the wrongs they had suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Yancy extended a big right hand, the knuckle of which was skinned and
      bruised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He were the meanest man I ever felt obliged fo' to hit with my fist,
      Nevvy; it appeared like he had teeth all over his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho&mdash;where's his hide, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; cried the little Cavendishes in
      an excited chorus. &ldquo;Sho&mdash;did you forget that?&rdquo; They themselves had
      forgotten the unique enterprise to which Mr. Yancy was committed, but the
      allusion to Slosson had revived their memory of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he begged so piteous to be allowed fo' to keep his hide, I hadn't
      the heart to strip it off,&rdquo; explained Mr. Yancy pleasantly. &ldquo;And the
      winter's comin' onat this moment I can feel a chill in the air&mdash;don't
      you-all reckon he's goin' to need it fo' to keep the cold out,' Sho', you
      mustn't be bloody-minded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it about Mr. Slosson's hide, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; demanded Hannibal.
      &ldquo;What was you a-goin' to do to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Nevvy, after he beat me up and throwed me in the river, I was some
      peevish fo' a spell in my feelings fo' him,&rdquo; said Yancy, in a tone of
      gentle regret. He glanced at his bruised hand. &ldquo;But I'm right pleased to
      be able to say that I've got over all them oncharitable thoughts of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you seen the judge, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; questioned Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've seen the judge. We was together fo' part of a day. Me and him
      gets on fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he now, Uncle Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he's back at Belle Plain by this time. You see we left him in
      Raleigh along after noon to 'tend to some business he had on hand. I never
      seen a gentleman of his weight so truly spry on his legs&mdash;and all
      about you, Nevvy; while as to mind! Sho&mdash;why, words flowed out of him
      as naturally as water out of a branch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of Hannibal's relationship to the judge he said nothing. He felt that was
      a secret to be revealed by the judge himself when he should see fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob, who'm I going to live with now?&rdquo; questioned Hannibal
      anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That p'int's already come up, Nevvy&mdash;him and me's decided that there
      won't be no friction. You-all will just go on living with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about you, Uncle Bob?&rdquo; cried Hannibal, lifting a wistful little
      face to Yancy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, me?&mdash;well, you-all will go right on living with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will come of Mr. Mahaffy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you-all will go right on living with him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob, you mean you reckon we are all going to live in one house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'low it will have to be fixed that-a-ways,&rdquo; agreed Yancy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. THE JUDGE RECEIVES A LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      After he had parted with Solomon Mahaffy the judge applied himself
      diligently to shaping that miracle-working document which he was preparing
      as an offset to whatever risk he ran in meeting Fentress. As sanguine as
      he was sanguinary he confidently expected to survive the encounter, yet it
      was well to provide for a possible emergency&mdash;had he not his
      grandson's future to consider? While thus occupied he saw the afternoon
      stage arrive and depart from before the City Tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Mr. Wesley, the postmaster, came sauntering up the
      street. In his hand he carried a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; he drawled, from just beyond the judge's open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge glanced up, his quill pen poised aloft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening, sir; won't you step inside and be seated?&rdquo; he asked
      graciously. His dealings with the United States mail service were of the
      most insignificant description, and in personally delivering a letter, if
      this was what had brought him there, he felt Mr. Wesley had reached the
      limit of official courtesy and despatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir; it looks like you'd never told us more than two-thirds of the
      truth!&rdquo; said the postmaster. He surveyed the judge curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am complimented by your opinion of my veracity,&rdquo; responded that
      gentleman promptly. &ldquo;I consider two-thirds an enormously high per cent to
      have achieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something in that, too,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Wesley. &ldquo;Who is Colonel
      Slocum Price Turberville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge started up from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have that honor,&rdquo; said he, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here's a letter come in addressed like that, and as you've been
      using part of the name I am willing to assume you're legally entitled to
      the rest of it. It clears up a point that off and on has troubled me
      considerable. I can only wonder I wa'n't smarter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What point, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, about the time you hung out your shingle here, some one wrote a
      letter to General Jackson. It was mailed after night, and when I seen it
      in the morning I was clean beat. I couldn't locate the handwriting and yet
      I kept that letter back a couple of days and give it all my spare time. It
      ain't that I'm one of your spying sort&mdash;there's nothing of the Yankee
      about me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; agreed the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Candid, Judge, I reckon you wrote that letter, seeing this one comes
      under a frank from Washington. No, sir&mdash;I couldn't make out who was
      corresponding with the president and it worried me, not knowing, more than
      anything I've had to contend against since I came into office. I calculate
      there ain't a postmaster in the United States takes a more personal
      interest in the service than me. I've frequently set patrons right when
      they was in doubt as to the date they had mailed such and such a letter.&rdquo;
       As Mr. Wesley sometimes canceled as many as three or four stamps in a
      single day he might have been pardoned his pride in a brain which thus
      lightly dealt with the burden of official business. He surrendered the
      letter with marked reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your surmise is correct,&rdquo; said the judge with dignity. &ldquo;I had occasion to
      write my friend, General Jackson, and unless I am greatly mistaken I have
      my answer here.&rdquo; And with a fine air of indifference he tossed the letter
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know Old Hickory?&rdquo; cried Mr. Wesley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Does it surprise you?&rdquo; inquired the judge. It was only his
      innate courtesy which restrained him from kicking the postmaster into the
      street, so intense was his desire to be rid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't know as it does, judge. Naturally a public man like him is in
      the way of meeting with all sorts. A politician can't afford to be too
      blame particular. Well, next time you write you might just send him my
      regards&mdash;G. W. M. de L. Wesley's regards&mdash;there was considerable
      contention over my getting this office; I reckon he ain't forgot. There
      was speeches made, I understand the lie was passed between two United
      States senators, and that a quid of tobacco was throwed in anger.&rdquo; Having
      thus clearly established the fact that he was a more or less national
      character, Mr. Wesley took himself off.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had disappeared from sight down the street, the judge closed the
      door. Then he picked up the letter. For along minute he held it in his
      hand, uncertain, fearful, while his mind slipped back into the past until
      his inward searching vision ferreted out a handsome soldierly figure&mdash;his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what Jackson remembers if he remembers anything!&rdquo; he muttered, as
      with trembling fingers he broke the seal. Almost instantly a smile
      overspread his battered features. He hitched his chin higher and squared
      his ponderous shoulders. &ldquo;I am not forgotten&mdash;no, damn it&mdash;no!&rdquo;
       he exulted under his breath, &ldquo;recalls me with sincere esteem and considers
      my services to the country as well worthy of recognition&mdash;&rdquo; the judge
      breathed deep. What would Mahaffy find to say now! Certainly this was well
      calculated to disturb the sour cynicism of his friend. His bleared eyes
      brimmed. After all his groping he had touched hands with the realities at
      last! Even a federal judgeship, though not an office of the first repute
      in the south had its dignity&mdash;it signified something! He would make
      Solomon his clerk! The judge reached for his hat. Mahaffy must know at
      once that fortune had mended for them. Why, at that moment he was actually
      in receipt of an income!
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, the better to enjoy the unique sensation. Taxes were being
      levied and collected with no other end in view than his stipend&mdash;his
      ardent fancy saw the whole machinery of government in operation for his
      benefit. It was a singular feeling he experienced. Then promptly his
      spendthrift brain became active. He needed clothes&mdash;so did Mahaffy&mdash;so
      did his grandson; they must take a larger house; he would buy himself a
      man servant; these were pressing necessities as he now viewed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again he reached for his hat, the desire to rush off to Belle Plain
      was overmastering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I'd be justified in hiring a conveyance from Pegloe,&rdquo; he
      thought, but just here he had a saving memory of his unfinished task; that
      claimed precedence and he resumed his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Pegloe's black boy presented himself to the judge. He came
      bearing a gift, and the gift appropriately enough was a square case bottle
      of respectable size. The judge was greatly touched by this attention, but
      he began by making a most temperate use of the tavern-keeper's offering;
      then as the formidable document he was preparing took shape under his hand
      he more and more lost that feeling of Spartan fortitude which had at first
      sustained him in the presence of temptation. He wrote and sipped in
      complete and quiet luxury, and when at last he had exhausted the contents
      of the bottle it occurred to him that it would be only proper personally
      to convey his thanks to Pegloe. Perhaps he was not uninspired in this by
      ulterior hopes; if so, they were richly rewarded. The resources of the
      City Tavern were suddenly placed at his disposal. He attributed this to a
      variety of causes all good and sufficient, but the real reason never
      suggested itself, indeed it was of such a perfidious nature that the
      judge, open and generous-minded, could not have grasped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      By six o'clock he was undeniably drunk; at eight he was sounding still
      deeper depths of inebriety with only the most confused memory of impending
      events; at ten he collapsed and was borne up-stairs by Pegloe and his
      black boy to a remote chamber in the kitchen wing. Here he was undressed
      and put to bed, and the tavernkeeper, making a bundle of his clothes,
      retired from the room, locking the door after him, and the judge was
      doubly a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rousing at last from a heavy dreamless sleep the judge was aware of a
      faint impalpable light in his room, the ashen light of a dull October
      dawn. He was aware, too, of a feeling of profound depression. He knew this
      was the aftermath of indulgence and that he might look forward to
      forty-eight hours of utter misery of soul, and, groaning aloud, he closed
      his eyes, Sleep was the thing if he could compass it. Instead, his memory
      quickened. Something was to happen at sunup&mdash;he could not recall what
      it was to be, though he distinctly remembered that Mahaffy had spoken of
      this very matter&mdash;Mahaffy, the austere and implacable, the
      disembodied conscience whose fealty to duty had somehow survived his own
      spiritual ruin, so that he had become a sort of moral sign-post, ever
      pointing the way yet never going it himself. The judge lay still and
      thought deeply as the light intensified itself. What was it that Mahaffy
      had said he was to do at sun-up? The very hour accented his suspicions.
      Probably it was no more than some cheerless obligation to be met, or
      Mahaffy would not have been so concerned about it. Eventually he decided
      to refer everything to Mahaffy. He spoke his friend's name weakly and in a
      shaking voice, but received no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon!&rdquo; he repeated, and shifting his position, looked in what should
      have been the direction of the shake-down bed his friend occupied. Neither
      the bed nor Mahaffy were there. The judge gasped he wondered if this were
      not a premonition of certain hallucinations to which he was not a
      stranger. Then all in a flash he remembered Fentress and the meeting at
      Boggs', something of how the evening had been spent, and a spasm of regret
      shook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had other things to think of. This must never happen again!&rdquo; he told
      himself remorsefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wide-awake now. Doubtless Pegloe had put him to bed. Well, that had
      been thoughtful of Pegloe&mdash;he would not forget him&mdash;the City
      Tavern should continue to enjoy his patronage. It would be something for
      Pegloe to boast of that judge Slocum Price Turberville always made his
      place headquarters when in Raleigh. Feeling that he had already conferred
      wealth and distinction on the fortunate Pegloe the judge thrust his fat
      legs over the side of his bed and stood erect. Stooping he reached for his
      clothes. He confidently expected to find them on the floor, but his hand
      merely swept an uncarpeted waste. The judge was profoundly astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I've got 'em on, I don't recall taking them off!&rdquo; he thought
      hopefully. He moved uncertainly in the direction of the window where the
      light showed him his own bare extremities. He reverted to his original
      idea that his clothes were scattered about the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was beginning to experience a great sense of haste, it was two miles to
      Boggs' and Fentress would be there at sun-up. Finally he abandoned his
      quest of the missing garments and turned to the door. To say that he was
      amazed when he found it locked would have most inadequately described his
      emotions. Breathing deep, he fell back a step or two, and then with all
      the vigor he could muster launched himself at the door. But it resisted
      him. &ldquo;It's bolted on the other side!&rdquo; he muttered, the full measure of
      Pegloe's perfidy revealing itself to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aghast. It was a plot to discredit him. Pegloe's hospitality had
      been inspired by his enemy, for Pegloe was Fentress' tenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he attacked the door; he believed it might be possible to force it
      from its hinges, but Pegloe had done his work too well for that, and at
      last, spent and breathless, the judge dropped down on the edge of his bed
      to consider the situation. He was without clothes and he was a prisoner,
      yet his mind rose splendidly to meet the difficulties that beset him. His
      greatest activities were reserved for what appeared to be only a season of
      despair. He armed himself with a threelegged stool he had found and turned
      once more to the door, but the stout planks stood firm under his blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I get out of here in time I'm a ruined man!&rdquo; thought the judge.
      &ldquo;After this Fentress will refuse to meet me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The window next engaged his attention. That, too, Pegloe had taken the
      precaution to fasten, but a single savage blow of the stool shattered
      glass and sash and left an empty space that framed the dawn's red glow.
      The judge looked out and shook his head dubiously. It was twelve feet or
      more to the ground, a risky drop for a gentleman of his years and build.
      The judge considered making a rope of his bedding and lowering himself to
      the ground by means of it, he remembered to have read of captives in that
      interesting French prison, the Bastille, who did this. However, an equally
      ingenious but much more simple use for his bedding occurred to him; it
      would form a soft and yielding substance on which to alight. He gathered
      it up into his arms, feather-tick and all, and pushed it through the
      window, then he wriggled out across the ledge, feet first, and lowering
      himself to the full length of his arms, dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He landed squarely on the rolled-up bed with a jar that shook him to his
      center. Almost gaily he snatched up a quilt, draping it about him after
      the manner of a Roman, toga, and thus lightly habited, started across Mr.
      Pegloe's truck-patch, his one thought Boggs' and the sun. It would have
      served no purpose to have gone home, since his entire wardrobe, except for
      the shirt on his back, was in the tavern-keeper's possession, besides he
      had not a moment to lose, for the sun was peeping at him over the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unobserved he gained the edge of the town and the highroad that led past
      Boggs' and stole a fearful glance over his shoulder. The sun was clear of
      the treetops, he could even feel the lifeless dust grow warm beneath his
      feet; and wrapping the quilt closer about him he broke into a labored run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some twenty minutes later Boggs' came in sight. He experienced a moment of
      doubt&mdash;suppose Fentress had been there and gone! It was a hideous
      thought and the judge groaned. Then at the other end of the meadow near
      the woods he distinguished several men, Fentress and his friends beyond
      question. The judge laughed aloud. In spite of everything he was keeping
      his engagement, he was plucking his triumph out of the very dregs of
      failure. The judge threw himself over the fence, a corner of the quilt
      caught on one of the rails; he turned to release it, and in that instant
      two pistol shots rang out sharply in the morning air.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. THE DUEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      It had been with no little reluctance that Solomon Mahaffy accompanied
      Yancy and Cavendish to Belle Plain; he would have preferred to remain in
      Raleigh in attendance upon judge Price. Intimately acquainted with the
      judge's mental processes, he could follow all the devious workings of that
      magnificent mind; he could fathom the simply hellish ingenuity he was
      capable of putting forth to accomplish temporary benefits. Permitting his
      thoughts to dwell upon the mingled strength and weakness which was so
      curiously blended in Slocum Price's character, he had horrid visions of
      that great soul, freed from the trammels of restraint, confiding his
      melancholy history to Mr. Pegloe in the hope of bolstering his fallen
      credit at the City Tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always where the judge was concerned he fluctuated between extremes of
      doubt and confidence. He felt that under the urgent spur of occasion his
      friend could rise to any emergency, while a sustained activity made
      demands which he could not satisfy; then his efforts were discounted by
      his insane desire to realize at once on his opportunities; in his haste he
      was for ever plucking unripe fruit; and though he might keep one eye on
      the main chance the other was fixed just as resolutely on the nearest
      tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the great stake which fate had suddenly introduced into their losing
      game, he wished earnestly to believe that the judge would stay quietly in
      his office and complete the task he had set himself; that with this off
      his hands the promise of excitement at Belle Plain would compel his
      presence there, when he would pass somewhat under the restraining
      influence which he was determined to exert; in short, to Solomon, life
      embraced just the one vital consideration, which was to maintain the judge
      in a state of sobriety until after his meeting with Fentress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purple of twilight was stealing over the land when he and his two
      companions reached Belle Plain. They learned that Tom Ware had returned
      from Memphis, that the bayou had been dragged but without results, and
      that as yet nothing had been heard from Carrington or the dogs he had gone
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Cavendish and Yancy set off across the fields. They were going
      on to the raft, to Polly and the six little Cavendishes, whom they had not
      seen since early morning; but they promised to be back at Belle Plain
      within an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      By very nature an alien, Mahaffy sought out a dark corner on the wide
      porch that overlooked the river to await their return. The house had been
      thrown open, and supper was being served to whoever cared to stay and
      partake of it. The murmur of idle purposeless talk drifted out to him; he
      was irritated and offended by it. There was something garish in this
      indiscriminate hospitality in the very home of tragedy. As the moments
      slipped by his sense of displeasure increased, with mankind in general,
      with himself, and with the judge&mdash;principally with the judge&mdash;who
      was to make a foolish target of himself in the morning. He was going to
      give the man who had wrecked his life a chance to take it as well.
      Mahaffy's cold logic dealt cynically with the preposterous situation his
      friend had created.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of his angry meditations he heard a clock strike in the hall
      and counted the strokes. It was nine o'clock. Surely Yancy and Cavendish
      had been gone their hour! He quitted his seat and strolled restlessly
      about the house. He felt deeply indignant with everybody and everything.
      Human intelligence seemed but a pitiable advance on brute instinct. A
      whole day had passed and what had been accomplished? Carrington, the
      judge, Yancy, Cavendish&mdash;the four men who might have worked together
      to some purpose had widely separated themselves; and here was the duel,
      the very climax of absurdity. He resumed his dark corner and waited
      another hour. Still no Carrington, and Yancy and Cavendish had not come up
      from the raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fools!&rdquo; thought Mahaffy bitterly. &ldquo;All of them fools!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last he decided to go back to the judge; and a moment later was
      hurrying down the lane in the direction of the highroad, but, jaded as he
      was by the effort he had already put forth that day, the walk to Raleigh
      made tremendous demands on him, and it was midnight when he entered the
      little town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can not be said that he was altogether surprised when he found their
      cottage dark and apparently deserted. He had half expected this. Entering,
      and not stopping to secure a candle, he groped his way up-stairs to the
      room on the second floor which he and the judge shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price!&rdquo; he called, but this gained him no response, and he cursed softly
      under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastily descended to the kitchen, lighted a candle, and stepped into
      the adjoining room. On the table was a neat pile of papers, and topping
      the pile was the president's letter. Being burdened by no false scruples,
      and thinking it might afford some clue to the judge's whereabouts, Mahaffy
      took it up and read it. Having mastered its contents he instantly glanced
      in the direction of the City Tavern, but it was wrapped in darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price is drunk somewhere,&rdquo; was his definite conclusion. &ldquo;But he'll be at
      Boggs' the first thing in the morning&mdash;most likely so far gone he can
      hardly stand!&rdquo; The letter, with its striking news, made little or no
      impression on him just then; it merely furnished the clue he had sought.
      The judge was off somewhere marketing his prospects.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time Mahaffy went up-stairs, and, without removing his clothes,
      threw himself on the bed. He was worn down to the point of exhaustion, yet
      he could not sleep, though the deep silence warned him that day was not
      far off. What if&mdash;but he would not let the thought shape itself in
      his mind. He had witnessed the judge's skill with the pistol, and he had
      even a certain irrational faith in that gentleman's destiny. He prayed God
      that Fentress might die quickly and decently with the judge's bullet
      through his brain. Over and over in savage supplication he muttered his
      prayer that Fentress might die.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to watch for the coming of the dawn, but before the darkness
      lifted he had risen from the bed and gone downstairs, where he made
      himself a cup of wretched coffee. Then he blew out his candle and watched
      the gray light spread. He was impatient now to be off, and fully an hour
      before the sun, set out for Boggs', a tall, gaunt figure in the shadowy
      uncertainty of that October morning. He was the first to reach the place
      of meeting, but he had scarcely entered the meadow when Fentress rode up,
      attended by Tom Ware. They dismounted, and the colonel lifted his hat.
      Mahaffy barely acknowledged the salute; he was in no mood for courtesies
      that meant nothing. Ware was clearly of the same mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an awkward pause, then Fentress and Ware spoke together in a low
      tone. The planter's speech was broken and hoarse, and his heavy, bloodshot
      eyes were the eyes of a haunted man; this was all a part of Fentress'
      scheme to face the world, and Ware still believed that the fires Hicks had
      kindled had served his desperate need.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first long shadows stole out from the edge of the woods Fentress
      turned to Mahaffy, whose glance was directed toward the distant corner of
      the field, where he knew his friend must first appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are we waiting, sir?&rdquo; he demanded, his tone cold and formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has occurred to detain Price,&rdquo; answered Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel and Ware exchanged looks. Again they spoke together, while
      Mahaffy watched the road. Ten minutes slipped by in this manner, and once
      more Fentress addressed Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what could have detained him?&rdquo; he inquired, the ghost of a
      smile curling his thin lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; said Mahaffy, and relapsed into a moody and anxious silence. He
      held dueling in very proper abhorrence, and only his feeling of intense
      but never-declared loyalty to his friend had brought him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another interval of waiting succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have about reached the end of my patience; I shall wait just ten
      minutes longer,&rdquo; said Fentress, and drew out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something has happened&mdash;&rdquo; began Mahaffy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have kept my engagement; he should have kept his,&rdquo; Fentress continued,
      addressing Ware. &ldquo;I am sorry to have brought you here for nothing, Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Mahaffy, planting himself squarely before Fentress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider this comic episode at an end,&rdquo; and Fentress pocketed his
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely!&rdquo; rejoined Mahaffy. His long arm shot out and the open palm of
      his hand descended on the colonel's face. &ldquo;I am here for my friend,&rdquo; he
      said grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel's face paled and colored by turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a weapon?&rdquo; he asked, when he could command his voice. Mahaffy
      exhibited the pistol he had carried to Belle Plain the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step off the ground, Tom.&rdquo; Fentress spoke quietly. When Ware had done as
      he requested, the colonel spoke again. &ldquo;You are my witness that I was the
      victim of an unprovoked attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ware accepted this statement with equanimity, not to say indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he asked; he glanced at Mahaffy, who by a slight
      inclination of the head signified that he was. &ldquo;I reckon you're a green
      hand at this sort of thing?&rdquo; commented Tom evilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mahaffy tersely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, listen: I shall count, one, two, three; at the word three you will
      fire. Now take your positions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy and the colonel stood facing each other, a distance of twelve
      paces separating them. Mahaffy was pale but dogged, he eyed Fentress
      unflinchingly. Quick on the word Fentress fired, an instant later
      Mahaffy's pistol exploded; apparently neither bullet had taken effect, the
      two men maintained the rigid attitude they had assumed; then Mahaffy was
      seen to turn on his heels, next his arm dropped to his side and the pistol
      slipped from his fingers, a look of astonishment passed over his face and
      left it vacant and staring while his right hand stole up toward his heart;
      he raised it slowly, with difficulty, as though it were held down by some
      invisible weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hush spread across the field. It was like one of nature's invisible
      transitions. Along the edge of the woods the song of birds was stricken
      into silence. Ware, heavy-eyed Fentress, his lips twisted by a tortured
      smile, watched Mahaffy as he panted for breath, with his hand clenched
      against his chest. That dead oppressive silence lasted but a moment, from
      out of it came a cry that smote on the wounded man's ears and reached his
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Price&mdash;&rdquo; he gasped, his words bathed in blood, and he pitched
      forward on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ware and Fentress had heard the cry, too, and running to their horses
      threw themselves into the saddle and galloped off. The judge midway of the
      meadow roared out a furious protest but the mounted men turned into the
      highroad and vanished from sight, and the judge's shaking legs bore him
      swiftly in the direction of the gaunt figure on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mahaffy struggled to rise, for he was hearing his friend's voice now, the
      voice of utter anguish, calling his name. At last painful effort brought
      him to his knees. He saw the judge, clothed principally in a gaily colored
      bed-quilt, hatless and shoeless, his face sodden and bleary from his
      night's debauch. Mahaffy stood erect and staggered toward him, his hand
      over his wound, his features drawn and livid, then with a cry he dropped
      at his friend's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon! Solomon!&rdquo; And the judge knelt beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, Price; I kept your appointment,&rdquo; whispered Mahaffy; a
      bloody spume was gathering on his lips, and he stared up at his friend
      with glassy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In very shame the judge hid his face in his hands, while sobs shook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon&mdash;Solomon, why did you do this?&rdquo; he cried miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The harsh lines on the dying man's face erased themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the only friend I've known in twenty years of loneliness, Price.
      I've loved you like a brother,&rdquo; he panted, with a pause between each word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the judge buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Solomon&mdash;I know it!&rdquo; he moaned wretchedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Price, you are still a man to be reckoned with. There's the boy; take
      your place for his sake and keep it&mdash;you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;by God, I will!&rdquo; gasped the judge. &ldquo;You hear me? You hear
      me, Solomon? By God's good help, I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have the president's letter&mdash;I saw it,&rdquo; said Mahaffy in a
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; cried the judge. &ldquo;Solomon, the world is changing for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me most of all,&rdquo; murmured Mahaffy, and there was a bleak instant when
      the judge's ashen countenance held the full pathos of age and failure.
      &ldquo;Remember your oath, Price,&rdquo; gasped the dying man. A moment of silence
      succeeded. Mahaffy's eyes closed, then the heavy lids slid back. He looked
      up at the judge while the harsh lines of his sour old face softened
      wonderfully. &ldquo;Kiss me, Price,&rdquo; he whispered, and as the judge bent to
      touch him on the brow, the softened lines fixed themselves in death, while
      on his lips lingered a smile that was neither bitter nor sneering.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. A CRISIS AT THE COURT-HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In that bare upper room they had shared, the judge, crushed and broken,
      watched beside the bed on which the dead man lay; unconscious of the
      flight of time he sat with his head bowed in his hands, having scarcely
      altered his position since he begged those who carried Mahaffy up the
      narrow stairs to leave him alone with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was living over the past. He recalled his first meeting with Mahaffy in
      the stuffy cabin of the small river packet from which they had later gone
      ashore at Pleasantville; he thanked God that it had been given him to see
      beneath Solomon's forbidding exterior and into that starved heart! He
      reviewed each phase of the almost insensible growth of their intimacy; he
      remembered Mahaffy's fine true loyalty at the time of his arrest&mdash;he
      thought of Damon and Pythias&mdash;Mahaffy had reached the heights of a
      sublime devotion; he could only feel enobled that he had inspired it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the dusk of twilight invaded the room. He lighted the candles on
      the chimneypiece, then he resumed his seat and his former attitude.
      Suddenly he became aware of a small hand that was resting on his arm and
      glanced up; Hannibal had stolen quietly into the room. The boy pointed to
      the still figure on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge, what makes Mr. Mahaffy lie so quiet&mdash;is he dead?&rdquo; he asked in
      a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear lad,&rdquo; began the judge in a shaking voice as he drew Hannibal
      toward him, &ldquo;your friend and mine is dead&mdash;we have lost him.&rdquo; He
      lifted the boy into his lap, and Hannibal pressed a tear-stained face
      against the judge's shoulder. &ldquo;How did you get here?&rdquo; the judge questioned
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob fetched me,&rdquo; said Hannibal. &ldquo;He's down-stairs, but he didn't
      tell me Mr. Mahaffy was dead-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have sustained a great loss, Hannibal, and we must never forget the
      moral grandeur of the man. Some day, when you are older, and I can bring
      myself to speak of it, I will tell you of his last moments.&rdquo; The judge's
      voice broke, a thick sob rose chokingly in his throat. &ldquo;Poor Solomon! A
      man of such tender feeling that he hid it from the world, for his was a
      rare nature which only revealed itself to the chosen few he honored with
      his love.&rdquo; The judge lapsed into a momentary brooding silence, in which
      his great arms drew the boy closer against his heart. &ldquo;Dear lad, since I
      left you at Belle Plain a very astonishing knowledge has come to me. It
      was the Hand of Providence&mdash;I see it now&mdash;that first brought us
      together. You must not call me judge any more; I am your grandfather your
      mother was my daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hannibal instantly sat erect and looked up at the judge, his blue eyes
      wide with amazement at this extraordinary statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very strange story, Hannibal, and its links are not all in my
      hands, but I am sure because of what I already know. I, who thought that
      not a drop of my blood flowed in any veins but my own, live again in you.
      Do you understand what I am telling you? Your are my own dear little
      grandson&mdash;&rdquo; and the judge looked down with no uncertain love and
      pride into the small face upturned to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad if you are my grandfather, judge,&rdquo; said Hannibal very gravely.
      &ldquo;I always liked you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear lad,&rdquo; responded the judge with equal gravity, and then as
      Hannibal nestled back in his grandfather's arms a single big tear dropped
      from the end of that gentleman's prominent nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be many and great changes in store for us,&rdquo; continued the
      judge. &ldquo;But as we met adversity with dignity, I am sure we shall be able
      to endure prosperity with equanimity, only unworthy natures are affected
      by what is at best superficial and accidental. I mean that the blight of
      poverty is about to be lifted from our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean we ain't going to be pore any longer, grandfather?&rdquo; asked
      Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge regarded him with infinite tenderness of expression; he was
      profoundly moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind saying that again, dear lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean we ain't going to be pore any longer, grandfather?&rdquo; repeated
      Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall enjoy an adequate competency which I am about to recover. It will
      be sufficient for the indulgence of those simple and intellectual tastes I
      propose to cultivate for the future.&rdquo; In spite of himself the judge
      sighed. This was hardly in line with his ideals, but the right to choose
      was no longer his. &ldquo;You will be very rich, Hannibal. The Quintard lands&mdash;your
      grandmother was a Quintard&mdash;will be yours; they run up into the
      hundred of thousand of acres here about; this land will all be yours as
      soon as I can establish your identity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will Uncle Bob be rich too?&rdquo; inquired Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. How can he be poor when we possess wealth?&rdquo; answered the
      judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You reckon he will always live with us, don't you, grandfather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not have it otherwise. I admire Mr. Yancy&mdash;he is simple and
      direct, and fit for any company under heaven except that of fools. His
      treatment of you has placed me under everlasting obligations; he shall
      share what we have. My one bitter, unavailing regret is that Solomon
      Mahaffy will not be here to partake of our altered fortunes.&rdquo; And the
      judge sighed deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Bob told me Mr. Mahaffy got hurt in a duel, grandfather?&rdquo; said
      Hannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was as inexperienced as a child in the use of firearms, and he had to
      deal with scoundrels who had neither mercy nor generous feeling&mdash;but
      his courage was magnificent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently Hannibal was deep in his account of those adventures he had
      shared with Miss Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Miss Malroy&mdash;where is she now?&rdquo; asked the judge, in the first
      pause of the boy's narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's at Mr. Bowen's house. Mr. Carrington and Mr. Cavendish are here
      too. Mrs. Cavendish stayed down yonder at the Bates' plantation.
      Grandfather, it were Captain Murrell who had me stole&mdash;do you reckon
      he was going to take me back to Mr. Bladen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see Miss Malroy in the morning. We must combine&mdash;our
      interests are identical. There should be hemp in this for more than one
      scoundrel! I can see now how criminal my disinclination to push myself to
      the front has been!&rdquo; said the judge, with conviction. &ldquo;Never again will I
      shrink from what I know to be a public duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later they went down-stairs, where the judge had Yancy make up a
      bed for himself and Hannibal on the floor. He would watch alone beside
      Mahaffy, he was certain this would have been the dead man's wish; then he
      said good night and mounted heavily to the floor above to resume his vigil
      and his musings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at daybreak Yancy was roused by the pressure of a hand on his
      shoulder, and opening his eyes saw that the judge was bending over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress!&rdquo; he said briefly. &ldquo;There's every prospect of trouble&mdash;get
      your rifle and come with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yancy noted that this prospect of trouble seemed to afford the judge a
      pleasurable sensation; indeed, he had quite lost his former air of somber
      and suppressed melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I let you sleep, thinking you needed the rest,&rdquo; the judge went on. &ldquo;But
      ever since midnight we've been on the verge of riot and possible
      bloodshed. They've arrested John Murrell&mdash;it's claimed he's planned a
      servile rebellion! A man named Hues, who had wormed his way into his
      confidence, made the arrest. He carried Murrell into Memphis, but the
      local magistrate, intimidated, most likely, declined to have anything to
      do with holding him. In spite of this, Hues managed to get his prisoner
      lodged in jail, but along about nightfall the situation began to look
      serious. Folks were swarming into town armed to the teeth, and Hues
      fetched Murrell across country to Raleigh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the sheriff has refused to take Murrell into custody. Hues has him
      down at the court-house, but whether or not he is going to be able to hold
      him is another matter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yancy and Hannibal had dressed by this time, and the judge led the way
      from the house. The Scratch Hiller looked about him. Across the street a
      group of men, the greater number of whom were armed, stood in front of
      Pegloe's tavern. Glancing in the direction of the court-house, he observed
      that the square before it held other groups. But what impressed him more
      was the ominous silence that was everywhere. At his elbow the judge was
      breathing deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are face to face with a very deplorable condition, Mr. Yancy. Court
      was to sit here to-day, but judge Morrow and the public prosecutor have
      left town, and as you see, Murrell's friends have gathered for a rescue.
      There's a sprinkling of the better element&mdash;but only a sprinkling. I
      saw judge Morrow this morning at four o'clock&mdash;I told him I would
      obligate myself to present for his consideration evidence of a striking
      and sensational character, evidence which would show conclusively that
      Murrell should be held to await the action of the next grand jury&mdash;this
      was after a conference with Hues&mdash;I guaranteed his safety. Sir, the
      man refused to listen to me! He showed himself utterly devoid of any
      feeling of public duty.&rdquo; The bitter sense of failure and futility was
      leaving the judge. The situation made its demands on that basic faith in
      his own powers which remained imbedded in his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had entered the court-house square. 'On the steps of the building
      Betts was arguing loudly with Hues, who stood in the doorway, rifle in
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you don't know this is county property?&rdquo; the sheriff was saying.
      &ldquo;And that you have taken unlawful possession of it for an unlawful
      purpose? I am going to open them doors-a passel of strangers can't keep
      folks out of a building their own money has bought and paid for!&rdquo; While he
      was speaking, the judge had pushed his way through the crowd to the foot
      of the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very nicely said, Mr. Betts,&rdquo; observed the judge. He smiled
      widely and sweetly. The sheriff gave him a hostile glare. &ldquo;Do you know
      that Morrow has left town?&rdquo; the judge went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't got nothing to do with judge Morrow. It's my duty to see that
      this building is ready for him when he's a mind to open court in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are willing to assume the responsibility of throwing open these
      doors?&rdquo; inquired the judge affably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shorely am,&rdquo; said Betts. &ldquo;Why, some of these folks are our leading
      people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge turned to the crowd, and spoke in a tone of excessive civility.
      &ldquo;Just a word, gentlemen!&mdash;the sheriff is right; it is your
      court-house and you should not be kept out of it. No doubt there are some
      of you whose presence in this building will sooner or later be urgently
      desired. We are going to let all who wish to enter, but I beg you to
      remember that there will be five men inside whose prejudices are all in
      favor of law and order.&rdquo; He pushed past Hues and entered the court-house,
      followed by Yancy and Hannibal. &ldquo;We'll let 'em in where I can talk to
      'em,&rdquo; he said almost gaily. &ldquo;Besides, they'll come in anyhow when they get
      ready, so there's no sense in exciting them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the court-house, Murrell, bound hand and foot, was seated between
      Carrington and the Earl of Lambeth in the little railed-off space below
      the judge's bench. Fear and suffering had blanched his unshaven cheeks and
      given a wild light to his deeply sunken eyes. At sight of Yancy a
      smothered exclamation broke from his lips, he had supposed this man dead
      these many months!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hues had abandoned his post and the crowd, suddenly grown clamorous,
      stormed the narrow entrance. One of the doors, borne from its hinges, went
      down with a crash. The judge, a fierce light flashing from his eyes,
      turned to Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what happens, this fellow Murrell is not to escape&mdash;if he
      calls on his friends to rescue him he is to be shot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hall was filling with swearing, struggling men, the floor shook
      beneath their heavy tread; then they burst into the court-room and saluted
      Murrell with a great shout. But Murrell, bound, in rags, and silent, his
      lips frozen in a wolfish grin, was a depressing sight, and the boldest
      felt something of his unrestrained lawlessness go from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Less noisy now, the crowd spread itself out among the benches or swarmed
      up into the tiny gallery at the back of the building. Man after man had
      hurried forward, intent on passing beyond the railing, but each lead
      encountered the judge, formidable and forbidding, and had turned aside.
      Gradually the many pairs of eyes roving over the little group surrounding
      the outlaw focussed themselves on Slocum Price. It was in unconscious
      recognition of that moral force which was his, a tribute to the grim
      dignity of his unshaken courage; what he would do seemed worth
      considering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was charmed to hear his name pass in a whisper from lip to lip. Well,
      it was time they knew him! He squared his ponderous shoulders and made a
      gesture commanding silence. Battered, shabby and debauched, he was like
      some old war horse who sniffs the odor of battle that the wind
      incontinently brings to his nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let him speak!&rdquo; cried a voice, and a tumult succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cool and indomitable the judge waited for it to subside. He saw that the
      color was stealing back into Murrell's face. The outlaw was feeling that
      he was a leader not overthrown, these were his friends and followers, his
      safety was their safety too. In a lull in the storm of sound the judge
      attempted to make himself heard, but his words were lost in the angry roar
      that descended on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let him speak! Kill him! Kill him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A score of men sprang to their feet and from all sides came the click of
      rifle and pistol hammers as they were drawn to the full cock. The judge's
      fate seemed to rest on a breath. He swung about on his heel and gave a
      curt nod to Yancy and Cavendish, who, falling back a step, tossed their
      guns to their shoulders and covered Murrell. A sudden hush grew up out of
      the tumult; the cries, angry and jeering, dwindled to a murmur, and a dead
      pall of silence rested on the crowded room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very taste of triumph was in the judge's mouth. Then came a commotion
      at the back of the building, a whispered ripple of comment, and Colonel
      Fentress elbowed his way through the crowd. At sight of his enemy the
      judge's face went from white to red, while his eyes blazed; but for the
      moment the force of his emotions left him speechless. Here and there, as
      he advanced, Fentress recognized a friend and bowed coolly to the right
      and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this ridiculous mockery mean?&rdquo; he demanded harshly. &ldquo;Mr.
      Sheriff, as a member of the bar, I protest! Why don't you clear the
      building?&rdquo; He did not wait for Betts to answer him, but continued. &ldquo;Where
      is this man Hues?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yonder, Colonel, by the captain,&rdquo; said Betts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a warrant for his arrest. You will take him into custody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried the judge. &ldquo;I represent Mr. Hues. I desire to see that
      warrant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fentress ignored him. He addressed the crowded benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, it is a serious matter forcibly to seize a man without
      authority from the courts and expose him to the danger of mob violence&mdash;Mr.
      Hues will learn this before we have done with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly there was a noisy demonstration that swelled into a burst of
      applause, which quickly spent itself. The struggle seemed to have narrowed
      to an individual, contest for supremacy between Fentress and the judge. On
      the edge of the railed off space they confronted each other: the colonel,
      a tall, well-cared-for presence; the judge shabby and unkempt. For a
      moment their eyes met, while the judge's face purpled and paled, and
      purpled again. The silence deepened. Fentress' thin lips opened, twitched,
      but no sound came from them; then his glance wavered and fell. He turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sheriff!&rdquo; he called sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Colonel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your man into custody,&rdquo; ordered Fentress. As he spoke he handed the
      warrant to Betts, who looked at it, grinned, and stepped toward Hues. He
      would have pushed the judge aside had not that gentleman, bowing civilly,
      made way for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my profound respect for the law and properly constituted authority I
      yield to no man, not even to Colonel Fentress,&rdquo; he said, with a gracious
      gesture. &ldquo;I would not place the slightest obstacle in the way of its
      sanctioned manifestation. Colonel Fentress comes here with that high
      sanction.&rdquo; He bowed again ceremoniously to the colonel. &ldquo;I repeat, I
      respect his dependence upon the law!&rdquo; He whirled suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cavendish&mdash;Yancy&mdash;Carrington&mdash;I call upon you to arrest
      John Murrell! I do this by virtue of the authority vested in me as a judge
      of the United States Federal Court. His crime&mdash;a mere trifle, my
      friends&mdash;passing counterfeit money! Colonel Fentress will inform you
      that this is a violation of the law which falls within my jurisdiction,&rdquo;
       and he beamed blandly on Fentress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a lie!&rdquo; cried the colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll answer for that later!&rdquo; said the judge, with abrupt austerity of
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all we know you may be some fugitive from justice! Why, your name
      isn't Price!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo; asked the judge quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're an impostor! Your name is Turberville!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to relieve your apprehensions. It is Turberville who has
      received the appointment. Would you like to examine my credentials?&mdash;I
      have them by me&mdash;no? I am obliged for your introduction. It could not
      have come at a more timely moment!&rdquo; The judge seemed to dismiss Fentress
      contemptuously. Once more he faced the packed benches. &ldquo;Put down your
      weapons!&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;This man Murrell will not be released. At the
      first effort at rescue he will be shot where he sits&mdash;we have sworn
      it&mdash;his plotting is at an end.&rdquo; He stalked nearer the benches. &ldquo;Not
      one chance in a thousand remains to him. Either he dies here or he lives
      to betaken before every judge in the state, if necessary, until we find
      one with courage to try him! Make no mistake&mdash;it will best conserve
      the ends of justice to allow the state court's jurisdiction in this case;
      and I pledge myself to furnish evidence which will start him well on his
      road to the gallows!&rdquo; The judge, a tremendous presence, stalked still
      nearer the benches. Outfacing the crowd, a sense of the splendor of the
      part he was being called upon to play flowed through him like some elixir;
      he felt that he was transcending himself, that his inspiration was drawn
      from the hidden springs of the spirit, and that he could neither falter
      nor go astray. &ldquo;You don't know what you are meddling with! This man has
      plotted to lay the South in ruins&mdash;he has been arming the negroes&mdash;it&mdash;it
      is incredible that you should all know this&mdash;to such I say, go home
      and thank God for your escape! For the others&rdquo;&mdash;his shaggy brows met
      in a menacing frown&mdash;&ldquo;if they force our hand we will toss them John
      Murrell's dead carcass&mdash;that's our answer to their challenge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He strode out among the gun muzzles which wavered where they still covered
      him. He was thinking of Mahaffy&mdash;Mahaffy, who had said he was still a
      man to be reckoned with. For the comfort of his own soul he was proving
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what a servile insurrection means?&mdash;you men who have
      wives and daughters, have you thought of their fate? Of the monstrous
      savagery to which they would be exposed? Do you believe he could limit and
      control it? Look at him! Why, he has never had a consideration outside of
      his own safety, and yet he expects you to risk your necks to save his! He
      would have left the state before the first blow was struck&mdash;his
      business was all down river&mdash;but we are going to keep him here to
      answer for his crimes! The law, as implacable as it is impartial, has put
      its mark on him&mdash;the shadow in which he sits is the shadow of the
      gallows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge paused, but the only sound in that expectant silence was the
      heavy breathing of men. He drew his unwieldy form erect, while his voice
      rumbled on, aggressive and threatening in its every intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are here to defend something that no longer exists. Your organization
      is wrecked, your signals and passwords are known, your secrets have become
      public property&mdash;I can even produce a list of your members; there are
      none of you who do not stand in imminent peril&mdash;yet understand, I
      have no wish to strike at those who have been misled or coerced into
      joining Murrell's band!&rdquo; The judge's sodden old face glowed now with the
      magnanimity of his sentiments. &ldquo;But I have no feeling of mercy for your
      leaders, none for Murrell himself. Put down your guns!&mdash;you can only
      kill us after we have killed Murrell&mdash;but you can't kill the law! If
      the arch conspirator dies in this room and hour, on whose head will the
      punishment fall?&rdquo; He swung round his ponderous arm in a sweeping gesture
      and shook a fat but expressive forefinger in the faces of those nearest
      him. &ldquo;On yours&mdash;and yours&mdash;and yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Across the space that separated them the judge grinned his triumph at his
      enemy. He had known when Fentress entered the room that a word or a sign
      from him would precipitate a riot, but he knew now that neither this word
      nor this sign would be given. Then quite suddenly he strode down the
      aisle, and foot by foot Fentress yielded ground before his advance. A
      murderous light flashed from the judge's bloodshot eyes and his right hand
      was stealing toward the frayed tails of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out&mdash;he's getting ready to shoot!&rdquo; cried a frightened voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly by doors and windows the crowd, seized with inexplicable panic,
      emptied itself into the courthouse yard. Fentress was caught up in the
      rush and borne from the room and from the building. When he reached the
      graveled space below the steps he turned. The judge was in the doorway,
      the center of a struggling group; Mr. Bowen, the minister, Mr. Saul and
      Mr. Wesley were vainly seeking to pinion his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Draw&mdash;damn you!&rdquo; he roared at Fentress, as he wrenched himself free,
      and the crowd swayed to right and left as Fentress was seen to reach for
      his pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Saul made a last frantic effort to restrain his friend; he seized the
      judge's arm just as the latter's finger pressed the trigger, and an
      instant later Fentress staggered back with the judge's bullet in his
      shoulder.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. THE END AND THE BEGINNING
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not strange that a number of gentlemen in and about Raleigh yielded
      to an overmastering impulse to visit newer lands, nor was it strange that
      the initial steps looking toward the indulgence of their desires should
      have been taken in secrecy. Mr. Pegloe was one of the first to leave; Mr.
      Saul had informed him of the judge's declared purpose of shooting him on
      sight. Even without this useful hint the tavern-keeper had known that he
      should experience intense embarrassment in meeting the judge; this was now
      a dreary certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You reckon he means near all he says?&rdquo; he had asked, his fat sides
      shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd take his word a heap quicker than I would most folks,&rdquo; answered Mr.
      Saul with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pegloe promptly had a sinking spell. He recalled the snuffing of the
      candles by the judge, an extremely depressing memory under the
      circumstances, also the reckless and headlong disregard of consequences
      which had characterized so many of that gentleman's acts, and his plans
      shaped themselves accordingly, with this result: that when the judge took
      occasion to call at the tavern, and the hostile nature of his visit was
      emphasized by the cautious manner of his approach, he was greatly shocked
      to discover that his intended victim had sold his business overnight for a
      small lump sum to Mr. Saul's brother-in-law, who had appeared most
      opportunely with an offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pegloe's flight created something of a sensation, but it was dwarfed by
      the sensation that developed a day or so later when it became known that
      Tom Ware and Colonel Fentress had likewise fled the country. Still later,
      Fentress' body, showing marks of violence, was washed ashore at a
      wood-yard below Girard. It was conjectured that he and Ware had set out
      from The Oaks to cross the river; there was reason to believe that
      Fentress had in his possession at the time a considerable sum of money,
      and it was supposed that his companion had murdered and robbed him. Of
      Ware's subsequent career nothing was ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were, after all, only episodes in the collapse of the Clan, sporific
      manifestations of the great work of disintegration that was going forward
      and which the judge, more than any other, perhaps, had brought about. This
      was something no one questioned, and he quickly passed to the first phase
      of that unique and peculiar esteem in which he was ever after held. His
      fame widened with the succeeding suns; he had offers of help which
      impressed him as so entirely creditable to human nature that he quite
      lacked the heart to refuse them, especially as he felt that in the
      improvement of his own condition the world had bettered itself and was
      moving nearer those sound and righteous ideals of morality and patriotism
      which had never lacked his indorsement, no matter how inexpedient it had
      seemed for him to put them into practice. But he was not diverted from his
      ultimate purpose by the glamour of a present popularity; he was able to
      keep his bleared eyes resolutely fixed on the main chance, namely the
      Fentress estate and the Quintard lands. It was highly important that he
      should go east to South Carolina to secure documentary evidence that would
      establish his own and Fentress' identity, to Kentucky, where Fentress had
      lived prior to his coming to Tennessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in November the judge set out by stage on his journey east; he was
      accompanied by Yancy and Hannibal, from neither of whom could he bring
      himself to be separated; and as the woods, flaming now with the touch of
      frost, engulfed the little town, he turned in his seat and looked back. He
      had entered it by that very road, a beggar on foot and in rags; he was
      leaving it in broadcloth and fine linen, visible tokens of his altered
      fortunes. More than this, he could thrust his hands deep down into his
      once empty pockets and hear the clink of gold and silver. The judge slowly
      withdrew his eyes from the last gray roof that showed among the trees, and
      faced the east and the future with a serenely confident expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty Malroy and Carrington had ridden into Raleigh to take leave of their
      friends. They had watched the stage from sight, had answered the last
      majestic salute the judge had given them across the swaying top of the
      coach before the first turn of the road hid it from sight, and then they
      had turned their horses' heads in the direction of Belle Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bruce, do you think judge Price will ever be able to accomplish all he
      hopes to?&rdquo; Betty asked when they had left the town behind. She drew in her
      horse as she spoke, and they went forward at a walk under the splendid
      arch of the forest and over a carpet of vivid leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he will, Betty,&rdquo; responded Carrington. Unfavorable as had been
      his original estimate of the judge's character, events had greatly
      modified it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He really seems quite sure, doesn't he?&rdquo; said Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's not a doubt in his mind,&rdquo; agreed Carrington.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still at Belle Plain, living in what had been Ware's office, while
      the Cavendishes were domiciled at the big house. He had arranged with the
      judge to crop a part of that hopeful gentleman's land the very next
      season; the fact that a lawsuit intervened between the judge and
      possession seemed a trifling matter, for Carrington had become infected
      with the judge's point of view, which did not admit of the possibility of
      failure; but he had not yet told Betty of his plans. Time enough for that
      when he left Belle Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      His silence concerning the future had caused Betty much thought. She
      wondered if he still intended going south into the Purchase; she was not
      sure but it was the dignified thing for him to do. She was thinking of
      this now as they went forward over the rustling leaves, and at length she
      turned in the saddle and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to miss Hannibal dreadfully&mdash;yes, and the judge, and Mr.
      Yancy!&rdquo; she began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when I leave&mdash;how about me, Betty?&rdquo; Carrington asked
      unexpectedly, but he only had in mind leaving Belle Plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little sigh escaped Betty's red lips, for she was thinking of the
      Purchase, which lay far down the river, many, many miles distant. The sigh
      was ever so little, but Carrington had heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to be missed, too, am I, Betty?&rdquo; he inquired, leaning toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, Bruce?&mdash;Oh, I shall miss you, too&mdash;dreadfully&mdash;but
      then, perhaps in five years, when you come back&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years!&rdquo; cried Carrington, but he understood, something of what was
      passing in her mind, and laughed shortly. &ldquo;Five years, Betty?&rdquo; he
      repeated, dwelling on the numeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty hesitated and looked thoughtful. Presently she stole a surreptitious
      glance at Carrington from under her long lashes, and went on slowly, as
      though she were making careful choice of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you come back in three years, Bruce&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington still regarded her fixedly. There was a light in his black eyes
      that seemed to penetrate to the most secret recesses of her heart and
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three years, Betty?&rdquo; he repeated again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, her eyes cast down, twisted her rein nervously between her slim,
      white fingers, but Carrington's steady glance never left her sweet face,
      framed by its halo of bright hair. She stole another look at him from
      beneath her dark lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three years, Betty?&rdquo; he prompted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bruce, don't stare at me that way, it makes me forget what I was going to
      say! When you come, back&mdash;next year&mdash;&rdquo; and then she lifted her
      eyes to his and he saw that they were full of sudden tears. &ldquo;Bruce, don't
      go away&mdash;don't go away at all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carrington slipped from the saddle and stood at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that, Betty?&rdquo; he asked. He took her hands loosely in his and
      relentlessly considered her crimsoned face. &ldquo;I reckon it will always be
      right hard to refuse you anything&mdash;here is one settler the Purchase
      will never get!&rdquo; and he laughed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the Purchase&mdash;you were going there!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wasn't, Betty; that notion died its natural death long ago. When we
      are sure you will be safe at Belle Plain with just the Cavendishes, I am
      going into Raleigh to wait as best I can until spring.&rdquo; He spoke so
      gravely, that she asked in quick alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, Bruce&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then&mdash;Oh, Betty, I'm starving&mdash;&rdquo; All in a moment he lifted
      her slender figure in his arms, gathering her close to him. &ldquo;And then,
      this&mdash;and this&mdash;and this, sweetheart&mdash;and more&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
      Betty! Betty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Murrell was brought to trial his lawyers were able to produce a host
      of witnesses whose sworn testimony showed that so simple a thing as
      perjury had no terrors for them. His fight for liberty was waged in and
      out of court with incredible bitterness, and, as judge and jury were only
      human, the outlaw escaped with the relatively light sentence of twelve
      years' imprisonment; he died, however, before the expiration of his term.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge, where he returned to Raleigh, resumed his own name of
      Turberville, and he allowed it to be known that he would not be offended
      by the prefix of General. During his absence he had accumulated a wealth
      of evidence of undoubted authenticity, with the result that his claim
      against the Fentress estate was sustained by the courts, and when The Oaks
      with its stock and slaves was offered for sale, he, as the principal
      creditor, was able to buy it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his first acts after taking possession of the property was to have
      Mahaffy reinterred in the grove of oaks below his bedroom windows, and he
      marked the spot with a great square of granite. The judge, visibly shaken
      by his emotions, saw the massive boulder go into place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harsh and rugged like the nature of him who lies beneath it&mdash;but
      enduring, too, as he was,&rdquo; he murmured. He turned to Yancy and Hannibal,
      and added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will lay me beside him when I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then when the bitter struggle came and he was wrenched and tortured by
      longings, his strength was in remembering his promise to the dead man, and
      it was his custom to go out under the oaks and pace to and fro beside
      Mahaffy's grave until he had gained the mastery of himself. Only Yancy and
      Hannibal knew how fierce the conflict was he waged, yet in the end he won
      that best earned of all victories, the victory over himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My salvation has been a costly thing; it was bought with the blood of my
      friend,&rdquo; he told Yancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Hannibal's privilege to give Cavendish out of the vast Quintard
      tract such a farm as the earl had never dreamed of owning even in his most
      fervid moments of imagining; and he abandoned all idea of going to England
      to claim his title. At the judge's suggestion he named the place Earl's
      Court. He and Polly were entirely satisfied with their surroundings, and
      never ceased to congratulate themselves that they had left Lincoln County.
      They felt that their friends the Carringtons at Belle Plain, though
      untitled people, were still of an equal rank with themselves; while as for
      the judge, they doubted if royalty itself laid it any over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Yancy accepted his changed fortunes with philosophic composure.
      Technically he filled the position of overseer at The Oaks, but the
      judge's activity was so great that this position was largely a sinecure.
      The most arduous work he performed was spending his wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain trifling peculiarities survived with the judge even after he had
      entered what he had once been prone to call the Portal of Hope; for while
      his charity was very great and he lived with the splendid air of plenty
      that belonged to an older order, it required tact, patience, and
      persistence to transact business with him; and his creditors, of whom
      there were always a respectable number, discovered that he esteemed them
      as they were aggressive and determined. He explained to Yancy that too
      great certainty detracted from the charm of living, for, after all, life
      was a game&mdash;a gamble&mdash;he desired to be reminded of this. Yet he
      was held in great respect for his wisdom and learning, which was no more
      questioned that his courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus surrounded by his friends, who were devoted to him, he began
      Hannibal's education and the preparation of his memoirs, intended
      primarily for the instruction of his grandson, and which he modestly
      decided to call The History of My Own Times, which clearly showed the
      magnificence of his mind and its outlook.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
